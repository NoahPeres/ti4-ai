# LRR Rule Implementation Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a semantic analysis of Living Rules Reference (LRR) rules and their implementation status in our TI4 framework. Each rule is analyzed for:

1. **Rule Content**: What the rule actually says
2. **Implementation Status**: How well it's implemented in our codebase
3. **Test Coverage**: Which tests demonstrate the rule is followed
4. **Implementation Quality**: Assessment of completeness and correctness
5. **Priority**: How critical this rule is for game integrity

## Analysis Methodology

- **Manual Semantic Review**: Each rule is read and understood semantically
- **Code Inspection**: Relevant code is examined for rule compliance
- **Test Mapping**: Existing tests are mapped to specific rules
- **Gap Analysis**: Missing implementations are identified
- **Priority Assessment**: Critical rules for game integrity are prioritized

## Rule Analysis

### 1. ABILITIES (Rules 1.1 - 1.27)

#### 1.1 Rules Reference Precedence
**Rule**: "If information in this Rules Reference contradicts the Learn to Play booklet, the Rules Reference takes precedence."

**Implementation Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No explicit precedence system exists
- **Tests**: No tests verify rule precedence
- **Assessment**: This is a meta-rule about rule interpretation, not directly implementable in code
- **Priority**: LOW (documentation/design principle)

#### 1.2 Card Ability Precedence  
**Rule**: "If a card ability contradicts information in the Rules Reference, the card takes precedence. If both the card and the rules can be followed at the same time, they should be."

**Implementation Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No ability precedence system exists
- **Tests**: No tests for ability precedence
- **Assessment**: Critical for card-based game mechanics
- **Priority**: HIGH (core game mechanic)

#### 1.3 Ability Description
**Rule**: "Each ability describes when and how a player can resolve it."

**Implementation Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
- **Code**: `Action` base class exists but no general ability system
- **Tests**: `tests/test_action.py` tests action interface
- **Assessment**: Basic structure exists but needs expansion
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

**Implementation Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No duration tracking system
- **Tests**: No duration tests
- **Assessment**: Complex temporal effect system needed
- **Priority**: HIGH (affects game state integrity)

#### 1.5 Action Abilities
**Rule**: "If an ability contains the word 'Action,' a player must use a component action during the action phase to resolve that ability."

**Implementation Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
- **Code**: `Action` class exists, component actions partially implemented
- **Tests**: Basic action tests exist
- **Assessment**: Framework exists but needs action phase integration
- **Priority**: HIGH

#### 1.6 Cannot Abilities
**Rule**: "If an ability uses the word 'cannot,' that effect is absolute."

**Implementation Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No "cannot" effect system
- **Tests**: No tests for absolute restrictions
- **Assessment**: Critical for rule enforcement
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 2. ACTION CARDS (Rules 2.1 - 2.8)

#### 2.1 Drawing Action Cards
**Rule**: "Each player draws one action card during each status phase."

**Implementation Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No status phase implementation
- **Tests**: No action card drawing tests
- **Assessment**: Core game flow missing
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 3. ACTION PHASE (Rules 3.1 - 3.5)

#### 3.1 Action Types
**Rule**: "During a player's turn, they may perform one of the following three types of actions: a strategic action, a tactical action, or a component action."

**Implementation Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
- **Code**: Action types exist in `src/ti4/actions/`
- **Tests**: `tests/test_action.py` tests action interface
- **Assessment**: Basic structure exists, needs integration
- **Priority**: HIGH

#### 3.2 Must Pass if Cannot Act
**Rule**: "If a player cannot perform an action, they must pass."

**Implementation Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
- **Code**: `GameController.pass_turn()` exists
- **Tests**: Some game controller tests exist
- **Assessment**: Pass mechanism exists but no enforcement of "must pass"
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

#### 3.3 No Further Actions After Pass
**Rule**: "After a player has passed, they have no further turns and cannot perform additional actions during that action phase."

**Implementation Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No pass state tracking
- **Tests**: No tests for post-pass restrictions
- **Assessment**: Critical for turn order integrity
- **Priority**: HIGH

#### 3.4 Must Perform Strategic Action
**Rule**: "A player cannot pass until they have performed the strategic action of their strategy card."

**Implementation Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
- **Code**: Strategy card system exists in `GameController`
- **Tests**: Some strategy card tests exist
- **Assessment**: Strategy cards exist but no pass restriction enforcement
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 4. ACTIVE PLAYER (Rules 4.1 - 4.3)

#### 4.1 Initiative Order
**Rule**: "During the action phase, the player who is first in initiative order is the first active player."

**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: `GameController.get_current_player()` and turn order management
- **Tests**: Game controller tests verify turn order
- **Assessment**: Well implemented
- **Priority**: HIGH (COMPLETE)

#### 4.2 Turn Advancement

**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: `GameController.advance_turn()`
- **Tests**: Turn advancement tests exist
- **Assessment**: Properly implemented
- **Priority**: HIGH (COMPLETE)

### 5. ACTIVE SYSTEM (Rules 5.1 - 5.4)

- **Priority**: HIGH

### 6. ADJACENCY (Rules 6.1 - 6.3)

### Critical Gaps Identified

1. **Ability System**: No general ability framework (Rules 1.2, 1.4, 1.6)

2. Implement ability duration tracking (Rule 1.4)
3. Expand adjacency rules for wormholes (Rule 6.1)

### Long-Term Goals
1. Complete semantic analysis of all LRR rules
2. Achieve 90%+ implementation coverage for HIGH priority rules
3. Establish continuous rule compliance monitoring
