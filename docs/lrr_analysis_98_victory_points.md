**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ `test_fourteen_point_victory_variant` - 14-point game support
- ✅ Standard 10-point victory conditions
- ✅ Victory condition checking during appropriate game phases

### 98.3 Victory Point Sources
**Rule**: "Victory points are primarily gained by scoring objective cards."

**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: Integration with objective system in `src/ti4/core/objective.py`
- **Tests**: `tests/test_rule_61_objectives.py` covers objective-based victory points
- **Assessment**: Victory points properly awarded through objective completion
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Dependencies**: Objective card system (Rule 61)
- **Notes**: Seamless integration with existing objective framework

### 98.4 Victory Point Maximum
**Rule**: "A player cannot have more victory points than the number required to win the game."

**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: Maximum enforcement in `GameState.award_victory_points()`
- **Tests**: `test_victory_point_maximum_enforcement` in `tests/test_rule_98_victory_points.py`
- **Assessment**: Proper maximum enforcement prevents exceeding victory threshold
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Dependencies**: Victory point awarding system
- **Notes**: Configurable maximum based on game variant (10 or 14 points)

### 98.5 Victory and Defeat Determination
**Rule**: "When a player wins the game, all other players lose."

**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: `GameState.has_winner()` and `get_winner()` methods handle victory/defeat states
- **Tests**: Victory determination tests in `tests/test_rule_98_victory_points.py`
- **Assessment**: Complete victory/defeat state management
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Dependencies**: Victory condition checking
- **Notes**: Clear winner determination with proper game end conditions

### 98.6 Legal Victory Points
**Rule**: "Victory points can only be gained through legal means as defined by the rules."

**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: Victory points only awarded through validated objective system
- **Tests**: Objective validation covered in objective system tests
- **Assessment**: Legal victory point validation through objective framework
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Dependencies**: Objective validation system
- **Notes**: Prevents illegal victory point gains through system validation

### 98.7 Game End Conditions and Tie Resolution
**Rule**: "If multiple players would simultaneously reach the victory point threshold, the player who is earliest in initiative order wins."

**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: Tie resolution methods in `GameState`:
  - `get_players_with_most_victory_points()`
  - `get_players_with_fewest_victory_points()`
  - Initiative order tie-breaking in `get_winner()`
- **Tests**: Comprehensive tie resolution tests in `tests/test_rule_98_victory_points.py`
- **Assessment**: Complete tie resolution system with initiative order support
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Dependencies**: Initiative order system (Rule 18)
- **Notes**: Handles all simultaneous victory scenarios correctly

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ `test_most_fewest_victory_points_tie_resolution` - Tie identification methods
- ✅ `test_simultaneous_victory_tie_resolution` - Initiative order tie-breaking
- ✅ Multiple player simultaneous victory scenarios

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components
1. **GameState Victory Point Management**
   - `victory_points: Dict[str, int]` - Per-player victory point tracking
   - `victory_points_to_win: int` - Configurable victory threshold (default 10)
   - Victory point awarding with maximum enforcement
   - Winner determination with tie-breaking

2. **Victory Condition Checking**
   - `has_winner()` - Check if any player has won
   - `get_winner()` - Determine winner with tie resolution
   - Integration with game phase management

3. **Tie Resolution System**
   - Most/fewest victory point identification
   - Initiative order tie-breaking
   - Simultaneous victory handling

### Integration Points
- **Rule 61 (Objectives)**: Victory points awarded through objective completion
- **Rule 18 (Initiative Order)**: Used for tie-breaking simultaneous victories
- **Game Phase System**: Victory checked during status phase
- **Player State**: Victory point tracking per player

## Test Coverage Summary
- **Primary Test File**: `tests/test_rule_98_victory_points.py` (4 comprehensive tests)
- **Supporting Tests**:
  - `tests/test_victory_conditions.py` (basic victory tracking)
  - `tests/test_rule_61_objectives.py` (objective-based victory points)
  - `tests/test_rule_61_secret_objectives.py` (secret objective victory points)
- **Coverage**: All Rule 98 sub-rules with edge cases and variants
- **Integration**: No breaking changes, all existing tests pass

## Performance Characteristics
- **Victory Point Tracking**: O(1) per player operations
- **Tie Resolution**: O(n) where n = number of players
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead for victory point state
- **Victory Checking**: Efficient condition evaluation

## Variant Support
- **Standard Games**: 10 victory points to win
- **14-Point Variant**: Configurable via `victory_points_to_win=14`
- **Custom Thresholds**: Supports any victory point threshold
- **Backward Compatibility**: Default behavior unchanged

## Priority Assessment
**Priority**: CRITICAL (COMPLETE)
**Implementation Status**: 100%
**Rationale**: Victory conditions are fundamental to game completion. All Rule 98 sub-rules are fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage, tie resolution, and variant support. Ready for production use.

## Related Rules
- **Rule 18**: Initiative Order (tie-breaking)
- **Rule 61**: Objective Cards (victory point sources)
- **Rule 84**: Status Phase (victory checking timing)

**Implementation Complete**: Rule 98 fully complies with LRR specifications and is production-ready.
