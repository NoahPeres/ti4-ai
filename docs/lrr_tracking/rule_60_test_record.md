# Rule 60 Neighbor Detection - Test Record

## LRR Reference
**Rule 60.0**: Two players are neighbors if they both have a unit or control a planet in the same system or in systems that are adjacent to each other.

## Test Scenario
Testing the core neighbor detection mechanics:
1. Players with units in the same system are neighbors
2. Players with units in adjacent systems are neighbors  
3. Players with units in non-adjacent systems are not neighbors

## Current Status
âœ… **REFACTOR PHASE - Complete with comprehensive tests**

## Implementation Details
- **Galaxy Class**: Added `are_players_neighbors()` method and `_get_player_systems()` helper
- **System Integration**: Leverages existing adjacency logic including wormhole support
- **Player Presence Detection**: Checks space units, planet units, and planet control
- **Wormhole Integration**: Automatically supports wormhole-based adjacency via existing Rule 6.1 implementation

## Test Coverage
- âœ… Same system neighbor detection
- âœ… Adjacent system neighbor detection  
- âœ… Non-adjacent system rejection
- âœ… Wormhole adjacency neighbor detection
- âœ… No units edge case
- ðŸ”„ **Future**: Add planet control tests
- ðŸ”„ **Future**: Add multiple systems per player tests

## TDD Phase
**RED âœ… â†’ GREEN âœ… â†’ REFACTOR âœ… (COMPLETE)**

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Implement basic neighbor detection logic
2. âœ… Ensure all core tests pass
3. âœ… Add comprehensive edge case tests
4. âœ… Add wormhole-based neighbor tests
5. ðŸ”„ Add planet control neighbor tests (requires Planet.controller implementation)
6. ðŸ”„ Performance optimization and caching (if needed)

## Dependencies
- âœ… Galaxy adjacency system (Rule 6.1)
- âœ… System and Unit classes
- âœ… Player class structure
- ðŸ”„ Planet control mechanics (future)

## Notes
- Successfully completed RED â†’ GREEN cycle
- All three core test cases passing
- Ready for REFACTOR phase with additional test coverage
- Integration with existing wormhole adjacency working correctly
