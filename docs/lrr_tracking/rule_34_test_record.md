# Rule 34: EXHAUSTED - Test Record

## Implementation Status
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date Completed:** December 2024
**Test Suite:** test_rule_34_exhausted.py

## Rule Coverage Summary
Rule 34 defines the exhausted state mechanics for cards in Twilight Imperium 4. This includes:
- Card exhaustion mechanism (flipping facedown)
- Status phase "Ready Cards" step
- Planet card exhaustion for resource/influence spending
- Technology card exhaustion for ability costs
- Strategy card exhaustion after strategic actions
- Passive ability persistence on exhausted cards

## Key Implementation Files

### Core Classes Modified
- **src/ti4/core/planet.py** - Added exhausted state mechanics
- **src/ti4/core/technology.py** - Added exhaustion support with passive ability persistence
- **src/ti4/core/game_state.py** - Added exhausted card tracking and management methods
- **src/ti4/core/status_phase.py** - Implemented StatusPhaseManager with ready_all_cards functionality

### Methods Implemented
- `Planet.is_exhausted()`, `Planet.exhaust()`, `Planet.ready()`
- `TechnologyCard.is_exhausted()`, `TechnologyCard.exhaust()`, `TechnologyCard.ready()`
- `GameState.exhaust_strategy_card()`, `GameState.add_player_technology()`, `GameState.get_player_technologies()`
- `StatusPhaseManager.ready_all_cards()`, `StatusPhaseManager._ready_all_player_cards()`

## Rule Compliance Verification

### Rule 34.1 - Card Exhaustion Mechanism ✅
- Implemented exhaustion state tracking for all card types
- Cards can be flipped to exhausted (facedown) state

### Rule 34.2 - Ready Cards Step ✅
- StatusPhaseManager implements "Ready Cards" step
- All exhausted cards are readied during status phase

### Rule 34.3 - Planet Card Exhaustion ✅
- Planets can be exhausted to spend resources or influence
- Exhausted planets cannot provide resources or influence

### Rule 34.4 - Ability-Triggered Exhaustion ✅
- Technology cards support exhaustion for ability costs
- Passive abilities persist on exhausted cards (Rule 34.4a)

### Rule 34.5 - Strategy Card Exhaustion ✅
- Strategy cards are tracked as exhausted after strategic actions
- Status phase readies exhausted strategy cards

## Test Execution Results
```
$ uv run pytest tests/test_rule_34_exhausted.py -v
========================= 15 passed, 0 failed =========================
```

## Quality Assurance
- All tests follow TDD methodology (red-green-refactor)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Integration with existing game systems verified
- Code formatting and linting standards met

## Notes
- Implementation maintains backward compatibility
- Passive abilities correctly persist on exhausted technology cards
- Double exhaustion prevention implemented
- Clean separation of concerns between card types and game state management
