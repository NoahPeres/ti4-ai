## CodeRabbit Review Response Summary

I have successfully addressed all the issues raised in the CodeRabbit review:

### 1. Fixed MECATOL_REX_ID Constant ✅
- **Issue**: `MECATOL_REX_ID` was set to `"mecatol_rex"` instead of `"18"`
- **Resolution**: Updated `src/ti4/core/constants.py` to use `"18"` as the value
- **Reasoning**: This aligns with the actual system ID used in the game rules

### 2. Fixed Command Token Consumption in Diplomacy ✅
- **Issue**: Diplomacy strategy card was placing command tokens without consuming player supply
- **Resolution**: Added proper logic in `diplomacy.py` to consume tokens from reinforcements first, then from command sheet (tactical → fleet → strategy)
- **Reasoning**: This follows the game rules for command token placement and prevents infinite token placement

### 3. Updated System Factory to Use Constants ✅
- **Issue**: `system_factory.py` used hardcoded `"18"` instead of `SystemConstants.MECATOL_REX_ID`
- **Resolution**: Updated `create_mecatol_rex_system` method to use the constant and added proper import
- **Reasoning**: Maintains consistency and makes the code more maintainable

### 4. Updated Diplomacy to Use Constants ✅
- **Issue**: `diplomacy.py` used hardcoded `"18"` instead of `SystemConstants.MECATOL_REX_ID`
- **Resolution**: Updated the system ID check to use the constant and added proper import
- **Reasoning**: Maintains consistency across the codebase

### 5. Added Planet Public Accessors ✅
- **Issue**: Tests were using direct attribute access (`planet.resources`, `planet.influence`) instead of public accessors
- **Resolution**:
  - Added `get_resources()` and `get_influence()` methods to the `Planet` class
  - Updated `test_system_factory.py` to use these public accessors
- **Reasoning**: This follows the API cleanup pattern and prepares for potential future changes to make these attributes private

### Testing and Quality Assurance ✅
- All tests pass (1314 passed, 2 skipped)
- Code formatting and linting checks pass
- Type checking passes for production code (src/)
- All pre-commit hooks pass

### Changes Committed and Pushed ✅
All changes have been committed and pushed to the `diplomacy` branch, which will trigger another CodeRabbit review to verify the fixes.

The implementation follows strict TDD practices and maintains backward compatibility while addressing all the review concerns.
