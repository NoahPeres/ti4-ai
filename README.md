## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Development Standards

**ALL AI AGENTS AND DEVELOPERS**: Before working on this project, you MUST read and follow the comprehensive development standards documented in [`.kiro/steering/ti4_development_standards.md`](.kiro/steering/ti4_development_standards.md).

These standards ensure:
- ✅ **90%+ test coverage** maintained for all implementations
- ✅ **Strict type safety** with zero compromises
- ✅ **TDD workflow** with mandatory RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles
- ✅ **Evidence-based development** with no assumptions
- ✅ **Critical path focus** on Rules 27, 92, 81, 89

**Quality gates are NEVER bypassed. When in doubt, ask rather than assume.**

## Installation

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if you haven't already
3. Create virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync --dev
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

### Alternative: Using uv run

You can also run commands directly with uv without activating the virtual environment:
```bash
uv run pytest
uv run black src tests
uv run mypy src
```

## Development

This project follows strict **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** practices. See `.kiro/steering/tdd-practices.md` for detailed guidelines that all contributors must follow.

### Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format with ruff (recommended)
uv run ruff format src tests

# Format with both ruff and black
make format

# Or format with black only
uv run black src tests
```

### Type Checking

```bash
uv run mypy src
```

### Linting

```bash
# Check for linting issues
uv run ruff check src tests

# Auto-fix linting issues where possible
uv run ruff check --fix src tests
```

### Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all quality checks (recommended before committing)
make check-all

# Or run individual checks:
make lint        # Linting with ruff
make type-check  # Type checking with mypy
make format      # Format code
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Game Setup

```python
from ti4.testing.scenario_builder import GameScenarioBuilder
from ti4.commands.manager import CommandManager
from ti4.core.events import GameEventBus
from ti4.core.observers import LoggingObserver

# Create a game scenario
game_state = (GameScenarioBuilder()
    .with_players(("alice", "sol"), ("bob", "xxcha"))
    .with_galaxy("standard_6p")
    .in_phase("action")
    .build())

# Set up command management and event handling
command_manager = CommandManager()
event_bus = GameEventBus()
logger = LoggingObserver()

event_bus.subscribe("unit_moved", logger.handle_event)

# Execute commands with full undo support
from ti4.commands.movement import MovementCommand

move_command = MovementCommand(
    unit_id="cruiser_1",
    from_system="home_system",
    to_system="mecatol_rex",
    player_id="alice",
    event_bus=event_bus
)

# Execute and automatically log/track
new_state = command_manager.execute_command(move_command, game_state)

# Undo if needed
previous_state = command_manager.undo_last_command(new_state)
```

### AI Integration Example

```python
from ti4.core.observers import AITrainingDataCollector

# Set up AI data collection
ai_collector = AITrainingDataCollector()
event_bus.subscribe("unit_moved", ai_collector.handle_event)
event_bus.subscribe("combat_resolved", ai_collector.handle_event)

# Play through game and collect training data
# ... execute many commands ...

# Export training data for machine learning
training_data = ai_collector.export_training_data()
```
