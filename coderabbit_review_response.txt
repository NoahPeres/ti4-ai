CodeRabbit Review Response for PR #27
==========================================

## Summary
CodeRabbit provided 19 comments (2 actionable, 17 nitpicks) on the diplomacy strategy card implementation.
I'll address each point systematically, implementing changes where they improve code quality and explaining
where I disagree with recommendations.

## Actionable Comments Analysis

### 1. StrategyCard Double-Exhaust Behavior (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Comment**: Change silent return to raise ValueError on double-exhaust to match Planet/Technology behavior
**Decision**: AGREE - Will implement
**Reasoning**: Consistency across the codebase is important. Planet and Technology classes raise exceptions
on double-exhaust, so StrategyCard should follow the same pattern for better error detection.

### 2. Remove hasattr Guards on Planet Methods (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Comment**: Remove hasattr checks on Planet.is_exhausted() and Planet.ready()
**Decision**: AGREE - Will implement
**Reasoning**: Planet class guarantees these methods exist. The hasattr guards add unnecessary complexity
and weaken type safety.

## Nitpick Comments Analysis

### Documentation Updates (LOW PRIORITY)
1. **Fix rule reference**: Change "Rule 83" to "Rule 32" in docstring - AGREE, simple fix
2. **Update review_response.txt**: Flip status from "WILL IMPLEMENT" to "DONE" - AGREE, reflects reality
3. **Remove obsolete LRR section**: Remove "Missing Implementation" section - AGREE, it's contradictory

### Code Quality Improvements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
4. **BaseStrategyCard initialization**: Add proper super().__init__() call - AGREE, good practice
5. **Magic string constant**: Replace "mecatol_rex" with constant - AGREE, improves maintainability
6. **Parameter naming consistency**: Use "planet_ids" consistently - DISAGREE, current naming is clear
7. **Token accounting**: Add proper CommandSheet API usage - PARTIALLY AGREE, will improve where feasible

### Test Coverage Enhancements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
8. **Mecatol Rex restriction test**: Add explicit test for primary ability rejection - AGREE, improves coverage
9. **Ready planet rejection test**: Add test for secondary ability on non-exhausted planets - AGREE, edge case coverage

### Implementation Details (LOW PRIORITY)
10. **Primary ability result flag**: Clarify "primary_ability_resolved" semantics - DISAGREE, current naming is adequate
11. **Token spending validation**: Use CommandSheet.spend_strategy_token() - AGREE where API exists

## Implementation Plan

HIGH PRIORITY (Will implement immediately):
- Remove hasattr guards on Planet methods
- Change StrategyCard.exhaust() to raise ValueError on double-exhaust
- Update tests to handle new exception behavior

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Will implement):
- Add BaseStrategyCard initialization
- Replace magic string with constant
- Add missing test cases
- Improve token spending where APIs exist

LOW PRIORITY (Will implement for completeness):
- Fix documentation references
- Update status files
- Clean up obsolete sections

DISAGREE/SKIP:
- Parameter naming changes (current names are clear and consistent within each method)
- Primary ability result flag changes (current semantics are adequate)
- Full token accounting system (beyond scope of current PR)

## Next Steps
1. Implement high-priority changes
2. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
3. Implement medium-priority improvements
4. Update documentation and status files
5. Commit and push changes for re-review
