CodeRabbit PR #27 Review Response - Round 2

## Summary
I have carefully reviewed and addressed ALL feedback from CodeRabbit's review of PR #27. Below is my detailed response to each comment:

## Critical Issues Addressed

### 1. Player ID Validation (Outside diff range comments)
**CodeRabbit's Concern**: Both primary and secondary abilities in Leadership strategy card should validate that `player.id` matches `player_id` to ensure operations are bound to the correct player.

**My Response**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Added player ID validation in both primary and secondary abilities
- Added check: `if player.id != player_id: return StrategyCardAbilityResult(success=False, ...)`
- This prevents unauthorized actions and ensures security
- **Reasoning**: This is a critical security fix that prevents potential exploits

### 2. Error Handling for spend_trade_goods (Outside diff range comments)
**CodeRabbit's Concern**: Should check the result of `spend_trade_goods` to avoid silent failures.

**My Response**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Added error handling for `spend_trade_goods` in both primary and secondary abilities
- Now properly returns failure result if trade goods spending fails
- **Reasoning**: Silent failures are dangerous and can lead to inconsistent game state

## Nitpick Issues Addressed

### 3. Rule Reference Correction
**CodeRabbit's Concern**: LRR Reference should be `Rule 32` instead of `Rule 83` in diplomacy.py

**My Response**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Updated the rule reference from "Rule 83" to "Rule 32" in diplomacy docstring
- **Reasoning**: Accurate documentation is important for maintainability

### 4. Error Message Clarity
**CodeRabbit's Concern**: Error messages should say "exactly" instead of "at least" for token allocation

**My Response**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Changed error messages from "at least" to "exactly" in both primary and secondary abilities
- Updated corresponding test assertions to match new error messages
- **Reasoning**: "Exactly" is more precise and matches the actual requirement
