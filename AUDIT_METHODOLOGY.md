# TI4 AI Implementation Status Audit Methodology

## Audit Approach

This document outlines the systematic methodology for conducting a comprehensive manual audit of all 101 LRR rules in the TI4 AI project.

## Information Sources

### 1. LRR Analysis Documents (`.trae/lrr_analysis/`)
- **Location**: `.trae/lrr_analysis/[NN]_[rule_name].md`
- **Coverage**: Rules 1-101 (complete coverage identified)
- **Structure**: Detailed sub-rule analysis with implementation status, priority, and test references
- **Quality**: Varies by rule - some comprehensive, others basic

### 2. Test Files (`tests/`)
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - `test_rule_[NN]_[rule_name].py` - Direct rule implementations
  - `test_[feature_name].py` - Feature-specific tests
  - `test_[component]_integration.py` - Integration tests
  - `test_[component]_[specific_aspect].py` - Detailed component tests
- **Coverage**: 200+ test files with comprehensive coverage patterns
- **Organization**: Well-structured with clear naming conventions

### 3. Production Code (`src/ti4/`)
- **Core Structure**:
  - `src/ti4/core/` - Main game mechanics (100+ files)
  - `src/ti4/actions/` - Action system
  - `src/ti4/commands/` - Command pattern implementation
  - `src/ti4/performance/` - Performance optimizations
  - `src/ti4/testing/` - Test utilities
- **Organization**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns

### 4. Specification Documents (`.kiro/specs/`)
- **Location**: `.kiro/specs/[feature-name]/`
- **Contents**: Requirements, design, and task documents
- **Status**: Multiple completed and in-progress specifications

## Status Classification System

### Implementation Categories
- **Fully Implemented**: Complete implementation with comprehensive tests and integration
- **Partially Implemented**: Core functionality exists but missing features, tests, or integration
- **Spec Only**: Requirements/design exist but no implementation
- **Not Started**: No evidence of implementation, specification, or planning

### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Core game mechanics that block other implementations
- **High**: Important features that significantly affect gameplay
- **Medium**: Supporting features and quality of life improvements
- **Low**: Edge cases, optimizations, and minor features

## Manual Analysis Process

### For Each Rule (1-101):

1. **Examine LRR Analysis Document**
   - Read `.trae/lrr_analysis/[NN]_[rule_name].md`
   - Note existing implementation status assessments
   - Identify any outdated or incomplete analysis

2. **Identify Related Test Files**
   - Search for `test_rule_[NN]_*.py` files
   - Look for feature-specific tests related to the rule
   - Check integration tests that might cover the rule
   - Assess test coverage quality and completeness

3. **Examine Production Code**
   - Identify relevant files in `src/ti4/core/`
   - Check for rule-specific implementations
   - Assess code quality and completeness
   - Verify integration with other systems

4. **Cross-Reference Specifications**
   - Check for related specs in `.kiro/specs/`
   - Note planned implementations
   - Assess specification completeness

5. **Write Executive Summary**
   - One paragraph per rule
   - Include rule number and title
   - Summarize current implementation status
   - Note what exists, what's missing, and priority assessment
   - Avoid technical implementation details

## Tracking Structure

### Per-Rule Information
- Rule number and title
- Implementation status category
- Priority level
- LRR analysis file status (exists/missing/outdated)
- Test files identified
- Production code files identified
- Specification documents identified
- Key gaps identified
- Executive summary paragraph

### Overall Audit Tracking
- Rules examined count (target: 101)
- Status category counts
- Priority level distribution
- Critical gaps list
- High-priority recommendations
- LRR analysis updates needed
- Test coverage gaps identified

## Quality Assurance

### Completeness Checks
- Verify all 101 rules are covered
- Ensure consistent paragraph structure
- Validate status classifications
- Cross-reference multiple sources

### Accuracy Validation
- Compare LRR analysis against actual code
- Verify test coverage claims
- Confirm implementation status assessments
- Document discrepancies found

### Consistency Maintenance
- Use uniform assessment criteria
- Apply consistent priority levels
- Maintain executive summary format
- Ensure actionable recommendations

## Expected Patterns

### Well-Implemented Rules
- Comprehensive LRR analysis with detailed sub-rule breakdown
- Multiple test files with good coverage
- Complete production code implementation
- Integration with related systems

### Partially Implemented Rules
- Basic LRR analysis or implementation notes
- Some test coverage but gaps identified
- Core functionality exists but missing features
- Limited integration with other systems

### Specification-Only Rules
- Detailed requirements and design documents
- Task lists for implementation
- No or minimal production code
- Placeholder or stub tests

### Not Started Rules
- Basic or missing LRR analysis
- No dedicated test files
- No production code implementation
- No specification documents

## Deliverable Structure

### Primary Document: TI4_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_AUDIT.md
- Executive summary with statistics
- 101 numbered paragraphs (one per rule)
- Summary statistics and completion percentages
- Priority recommendations
- Critical gaps identification

### Supporting Documentation
- LRR analysis files needing updates
- Test coverage gaps by rule
- Priority implementation roadmap
- Audit methodology documentation

## Success Criteria

1. **Complete Coverage**: All 101 rules analyzed and documented
2. **Accurate Assessment**: Implementation status verified against actual code
3. **Actionable Insights**: Clear priorities and next steps identified
4. **Quality Documentation**: Executive-level summaries for decision-making
5. **Project Clarity**: Comprehensive understanding of current state
