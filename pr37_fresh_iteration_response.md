## Critical Issues Analysis

### Issue 1: Invalid Planet Landing Validation (Critical)
**Location**: `src/ti4/core/invasion.py:52`
**Severity**: Major
**Problem**: `can_land_transported_ground_forces` returns `True` for any transport with ground forces, even with invalid planet names, causing downstream `ValueError` crashes.

### Issue 2: Unsafe Unit Removal During Movement (Critical)
**Location**: `src/ti4/core/movement.py:142`
**Severity**: Major
**Problem**: `System.remove_unit_from_space` crashes when transported units aren't in space list, which will happen with proper boarding implementation.

### Issue 3: Silent Transport Overflow Bug (Critical)
**Location**: `src/ti4/core/transport.py:402` (and 728-766, 857-883)
**Severity**: Critical
**Problem**: Transport planners silently drop overflow units instead of raising errors, causing units to disappear from plans.

### Issue 4: Incomplete Pre-transport Validation (Major)
**Location**: `src/ti4/core/transport.py:646`
**Severity**: Major
**Problem**: Pre-transport validator only raises for capacity issues, not for invalid unit types, leading to generic downstream errors.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Transport Validation Fixes

#### 1.1 Fix Planet Landing Validation
```python
# In src/ti4/core/invasion.py
def can_land_transported_ground_forces(self, transport_state: TransportState, planet_name: str) -> bool:
    """Check if transported ground forces can land on specified planet."""
    if not planet_name:
        return False

    try:
        self._find_planet_by_name(planet_name)
    except ValueError:
        return False

    return self._has_ground_forces_in_transport(transport_state)

def _has_ground_forces_in_transport(self, transport_state: TransportState) -> bool:
    """Helper to check if transport contains ground forces."""
    return any(
        unit.unit_type in [UnitType.INFANTRY, UnitType.MECH]
        for unit in transport_state.transported_units
    )
```

#### 1.2 Guard Unit Removal During Movement
```python
# In src/ti4/core/movement.py
for transported_unit in transport_state.transported_units:
    # Remove from source system (guard against missing units)
    if transported_unit in from_system.get_units_in_space():
        from_system.remove_unit_from_space(transported_unit)
    # Place in destination system (transported units remain in space)
    to_system.place_unit_in_space(transported_unit)
```

### Phase 2: Transport Planning Correctness

#### 2.1 Fix Silent Overflow in Distribution Helpers
```python
# In src/ti4/core/transport.py - Apply to all three helpers
def _create_distribution_with_strategy(self, fleet: Fleet, units: List[Unit]) -> List[TransportState]:
    # ... existing distribution logic ...

    if units_remaining:
        total_capacity = fleet.get_total_capacity()
        raise TransportCapacityError(
            f"Cannot distribute {len(units)} units across fleet capacity {total_capacity}",
            ship_type=None,
            ship_capacity=total_capacity,
            units_requested=len(units),
        )

    # Add empty transport states for remaining ships
    self._add_empty_transport_states(transport_states, ships_with_capacity, fleet)
    return transport_states
```

#### 2.2 Comprehensive Pre-transport Validation
```python
# In src/ti4/core/transport.py
def validate_pre_transport(self, ship: Unit, units: List[Unit]) -> None:
    if not self.transport_manager.can_transport_units(ship, units):
        ship_capacity = ship.get_capacity()
        units_requested = len(units)

        invalid_types = [
            unit.unit_type.name
            for unit in units
            if unit.unit_type not in TRANSPORTABLE_UNIT_TYPES
        ]

        if units_requested > ship_capacity:
            raise TransportCapacityError(
                f"Pre-transport validation failed: Cannot transport {units_requested} units with ship capacity {ship_capacity}",
                ship_type=ship.unit_type.name,
                ship_capacity=ship_capacity,
                units_requested=units_requested,
            )

        if invalid_types:
            raise TransportCapacityError(
                "Pre-transport validation failed: only fighters, infantry, and mechs may be transported",
                ship_type=ship.unit_type.name,
                ship_capacity=ship_capacity,
                units_requested=units_requested,
            )

        raise TransportCapacityError(
            "Pre-transport validation failed: transport manager rejected the requested units",
            ship_type=ship.unit_type.name,
            ship_capacity=ship_capacity,
            units_requested=units_requested,
        )
```

## Test Strategy

### Critical Test Coverage Required

1. **Planet Validation Tests**
   - Test `can_land_transported_ground_forces` with invalid planet names
   - Test `can_land_transported_ground_forces` with empty planet names
   - Verify proper error handling in invasion flow

2. **Unit Movement Safety Tests**
   - Test movement with units not in space list
   - Test proper boarding/unboarding scenarios
   - Verify no crashes during transport movement

3. **Transport Overflow Tests**
   - Test all three distribution helpers with overflow scenarios
   - Verify `TransportCapacityError` is raised for excess units
   - Test edge cases with zero capacity fleets

4. **Pre-transport Validation Tests**
   - Test validation with invalid unit types
   - Test validation with mixed valid/invalid units
   - Verify specific error messages for different failure modes

## Quality Assurance

### TDD Implementation Approach

1. **RED Phase**: Write failing tests for each identified issue
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implement minimal fixes to pass tests
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Clean up implementation and add comprehensive error handling

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Run transport-specific tests
uv run pytest tests/test_rule_95_transport.py -v

# Run movement integration tests
uv run pytest tests/test_movement.py -v

# Run invasion integration tests
uv run pytest tests/test_invasion.py -v

# Full quality gate
make quality-gate
```

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Transport State Management** - Changes to unit removal logic
2. **Error Propagation** - New exception raising patterns
3. **Integration Points** - Movement/invasion/transport coordination

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage** - Test all error paths
