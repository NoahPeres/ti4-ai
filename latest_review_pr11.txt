`91-99`: **Validate player existence in award_victory_points.**

Currently accepts any player_id; consider rejecting unknown IDs to prevent silent state skew.

Apply inline guard:

```diff
 def award_victory_points(self, player_id: str, points: int) -> "GameState":
     """Award victory points to a player, returning a new GameState."""
+    if player_id not in (p.id for p in self.players):
+        raise ValueError(f"Unknown player_id '{player_id}'")
     new_victory_points = self.victory_points.copy()
```

---

`112-129`: **Tie-breaker should use actual initiative order, not players list order.**

players list may not reflect current initiative. Prefer StrategyCardCoordinator (if present) or strategy_card_assignments to derive order; fallback to players list.

Example sketch (adjust to actual API):

```python
# Determine initiative-ordered player IDs
order: list[str]
if self.strategy_card_coordinator:
    # ideally expose a typed API on the coordinator
    order = self.strategy_card_coordinator.get_initiative_order_player_ids()
elif self.strategy_card_assignments:
    # sort by the strategy card’s initiative value
    order = sorted(
        self.strategy_card_assignments.items(),
        key=lambda kv: kv[1].initiative,  # or .number/.order as available
    )
    order = [pid for pid, _ in order]
else:
    order = [p.id for p in self.players]

for pid in order:
    if pid in winners:
        return pid
```


If no public API exists, consider adding get_initiative_order_player_ids() to StrategyCardCoordinator and using it here.

---

`130-141`: **Deterministic ordering for ties (optional).**

For stability, return tied players in initiative order rather than dict iteration order.

```diff
-    return [
-        player_id
-        for player_id, points in self.victory_points.items()
-        if points == max_points
-    ]
+    order = [p.id for p in self.players]
+    return [pid for pid in order if self.victory_points.get(pid, 0) == max_points]
```

---

`142-152`: **Mirror the same deterministic ordering for fewest.**

Keep outputs consistent across helpers.

```diff
-    min_points = min(self.victory_points.values())
-    return [
-        player_id
-        for player_id, points in self.victory_points.items()
-        if points == min_points
-    ]
+    min_points = min(self.victory_points.values())
+    order = [p.id for p in self.players]
+    return [pid for pid in order if self.victory_points.get(pid, 0) == min_points]

`11-12`: **Fix conflicting progress values (24.9% vs 25.9%).**

Top header still shows 24.9% (Line 4) while this block says 25.9%. Unify to one source of truth and bump the “Last Updated” date accordingly.

Apply this diff to remove the duplicate header metric here (keep the single source near the top), or update the top header instead:

`50-59`: **Metrics section conflicts with later documents (e.g., 850+ tests here vs 1052 elsewhere).**

Unify total test count, coverage, and quality claims; consider generating these values from CI artifacts to avoid drift.



```diff
-### 📈 Current Metrics
-- **Tests**: 850+ total tests, all passing (Rule 78: 17 tests, Rule 34: 15 tests, Rule 83: 50+ tests)

Optional: add a badge or CI step to write these into a JSON the doc can include.

---

`51-54`: **Check “9/8 rules (112.5%)” phrasing.**

If the denominator changed, adjust the denominator or add a footnote; as-is it’s confusing.

In docs/lrr_tracking/rule_98_test_record.md around lines 55 to 61, the
documented GameState __init__(victory_points_to_win=10) signature is incorrect;
the real constructor is GameStateManager.__init__(self, game_state:
Optional[GameState] = None) in src/ti4/core/game_state_manager.py (around line
95) and the methods referenced exist in src/ti4/core/game_state.py (defs ≈ lines
87, 103, 110, 130, 142). Update the docs to either (a) remove the incorrect
GameState __init__ signature and reference GameStateManager with its actual
constructor, or (b) if you intended to document a configurable victory
threshold, add a correct note describing where that configuration lives and how
to set it (pointing to the proper class/method), and keep the listed method
names as-is with links to their actual definitions.

  Body: _⚠️ Potential issue_

<details>
<summary>🧩 Analysis chain</summary>

**Critical: VP max enforcement bypassed when scoring objectives.**

award_victory_points enforces the cap, but score_objective -> _update_victory_points does not, allowing totals > victory_points_to_win. Enforce the same check in _update_victory_points (preferred) so all paths are consistent.

Apply this diff (outside the current hunk) to _update_victory_points:

```diff
@@
 def _update_victory_points(
     self, player_id: str, objective: "Objective"
 ) -> dict[str, int]:
     """Update the victory points for the player."""
     new_victory_points = self.victory_points.copy()
     current_points = new_victory_points.get(player_id, 0)
-    new_victory_points[player_id] = current_points + objective.points
+    new_total = current_points + objective.points
+    if new_total > self.victory_points_to_win:
+        raise ValueError(
+            f"Player {player_id} cannot exceed maximum victory points ({self.victory_points_to_win}) when scoring objective '{objective.id}'"
+        )
+    new_victory_points[player_id] = new_total
     return new_victory_points
```


Run to confirm all VP award sites and ensure the above method is used for objective scoring:

**Critical: enforce VP cap in _update_victory_points — objective scoring currently bypasses award_victory_points**

score_objective calls _update_victory_points (src/ti4/core/game_state.py:428) while award_victory_points enforces the cap (src/ti4/core/game_state.py:87). Add the same cap check to _update_victory_points to prevent totals > victory_points_to_win.

```diff

 def _update_victory_points(
     self, player_id: str, objective: "Objective"

Comment 3:
  File: tests/test_rule_98_victory_points.py
  Line: 111
  Body: _⚠️ Potential issue_

**Add a test for max enforcement when scoring objectives (not just direct awards).**

Currently, objective scoring can exceed the max due to missing cap in _update_victory_points.

Add:

```python
def test_vp_max_enforcement_when_scoring_objectives() -> None:
    player = Player(id="p1", faction="sol")
    gs = GameState(players=[player])
    gs = gs.award_victory_points("p1", 9)
    obj = Objective(
        id="obj_max",
        name="Push over cap",
        description="",
        points=2,
        is_public=True,
        scoring_phase=GamePhase.STATUS,
    )
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="cannot exceed maximum victory points"):
        gs.score_objective("p1", obj, GamePhase.STATUS)
```

<details>
<summary>🤖 Prompt for AI Agents</summary>

```
In tests/test_rule_98_victory_points.py around lines 98–111, add a new test that
verifies scoring an objective cannot push a player's victory points past the
maximum: create a player, award 9 points, construct an Objective with points=2
and scoring_phase=GamePhase.STATUS, then assert that calling
GameState.score_objective for that player raises ValueError matching "cannot
exceed maximum victory points". If production code currently allows objective
scoring to bypass the cap, update GameState._update_victory_points (and ensure
score_objective uses it) to enforce the maximum by either capping or—preferably
for test compatibility—raising ValueError when the new total would exceed the
configured maximum.
