You already import InvalidPlayerError at module scope (Line 8). Drop the inner import for consistency.

ValueError works, but a domain ValidationError (field="card_id") would match other validations.

`18-18`: **Bug risk: using owner to encode faction breaks owner semantics.**

Unit.owner is a player ID; Arborec restriction should check unit.faction, not owner text. This test forces a brittle production rule that inspects owner for ‚Äúarborec‚Äù.


Recommended fix (test side) ‚Äî keep a real owner and set faction:

```diff

```

Follow-up (prod side, in ProductionAbilityManager): gate the restriction on unit.faction == Faction.ARBOREC.


I can scan src/ti4/core/production_ability.py and draft the minimal change if you want.

**Correct the tie‚Äëbreaking documentation and source note.**

Document speaker‚Äëorder fallback during Status Phase and clearly state implementation status.


Apply:

```diff
-## Tie-Breaking Documentation
-**Current Implementation**: The tie-breaking logic for simultaneous victories uses the initiative order from the current game phase. When multiple players would reach 10 victory points simultaneously during the Status Phase, the system resolves initiative order for that specific phase as specified in rule 98.7.
-
-**Source**: This implementation follows the exact wording in LRR 98.7 which states "if this occurs when players are scoring during the Status Phase, resolve initiative order for that phase."
+## Tie-Breaking Documentation
+**Current Implementation**: Uses initiative order from StrategyCardCoordinator. During Status Phase, ties must resolve by speaker order (clockwise from the speaker) if players do not have strategy cards.
+
+**Source**: LRR 98.7 specifies speaker‚Äëorder fallback when players do not have strategy cards.
+**TODO**: Ensure `get_status_phase_initiative_order()` returns speaker‚Äëbased ordering when no strategy cards are assigned; add tests.
```

**Fix tie‚Äëbreaking docs or implement speaker‚Äëorder fallback (LRR 98.7)**

- Issue: .trae/lrr_analysis/98_victory_points.md claims Status Phase falls back to speaker order when players have no strategy cards, but the code does not implement that fallback. GameState uses strategy_card_coordinator.get_status_phase_initiative_order() (src/ti4/core/game_state.py ‚âà182‚Äì186); StrategyCardCoordinator.get_status_phase_initiative_order() (src/ti4/core/strategy_cards/coordinator.py:482) calls _get_current_initiative_order() -> calculate_initiative_order(self._card_assignments) and thus orders only by assigned cards.

- Action: Either update the documentation to reflect the current behavior (Status Phase uses StrategyCardCoordinator's card‚Äëbased ordering and there is no speaker fallback), or implement the required fallback in StrategyCardCoordinator.get_status_phase_initiative_order to include players without assigned cards ordered by self._speaker_order (speaker‚Äëfirst), and add unit tests for no‚Äëcard and mixed‚Äëassignment cases.

<details>
<summary>ü§ñ Prompt for AI Agents</summary>

```
.trae/lrr_analysis/98_victory_points.md around lines 23 to 27: the doc claims
Status Phase falls back to speaker order when players have no strategy cards but
the code currently only orders players by assigned strategy cards; implement the
fallback in StrategyCardCoordinator.get_status_phase_initiative_order
(src/ti4/core/strategy_cards/coordinator.py) so that after
calculate_initiative_order(self._card_assignments) you append any players
without assigned cards in the order of self._speaker_order (speaker-first),
update GameState usage if needed, and add unit tests covering the no-card-only
and mixed-assignment cases; alternatively, if you prefer the doc change route,
update .trae/lrr_analysis/98_victory_points.md to state that Status Phase uses
only card-based ordering with no speaker fallback and adjust tests/coverage
accordingly.

validation for the points parameter: first verify points is an integer (raise
TypeError or ValueError if not an int), and then reject negative awards by
raising ValueError when points < 0 (allow zero or positive only). Keep these

**Sort all players by initiative; treat unassigned players as highest (999).**

When a strategy_card_assignments dict exists the current code only sorts assigned players and appends others in dict iteration order (nondeterministic). Replace the elif block in src/ti4/core/game_state.py with the diff below:

```diff
@@ def _sort_players_by_initiative_order(self, player_ids: list[str]) -> list[str]:
-        elif self.strategy_card_assignments:
-            # Sort by strategy card initiative numbers
-            from .strategy_cards.coordinator import STRATEGY_CARD_INITIATIVE_NUMBERS
-
-            player_initiatives = [
-                (

Verified: src/ti4/core/strategy_cards/coordinator.py:get_status_phase_initiative_order() ‚Üí _get_current_initiative_order() ‚Üí calculate_initiative_order(self._card_assignments). calculate_initiative_order() returns [] when no assignments (no speaker-order fallback). (See coordinator.calculate_initiative_order around line ~238 and get_status_phase_initiative_order around line ~482.)

If STATUS should fall back to speaker order per Rule 98.7, update coordinator.get_status_phase_initiative_order() to return speaker order when _card_assignments is empty or have GameState handle an empty initiative list explicitly.

In src/ti4/core/game_state.py around lines 171-219, when
strategy_card_assignments exists the code only sorts assigned players and leaves
others in nondeterministic dict order; update the elif block to treat every
player (use self.players order or all player IDs) as having an initiative value:
look up their assigned card in self.strategy_card_assignments and map to
STRATEGY_CARD_INITIATIVE_NUMBERS, defaulting to 999 for unassigned players, then
sort that full list by initiative (and stable tie-breaker such as speaker/order
index) and set initiative_order from that sorted list so unassigned players
consistently appear with highest initiative.
