# CodeRabbit Review Analysis for PR #29

## Summary of Review Comments

Based on the CodeRabbit review, there are several actionable comments that need to be addressed. Let me analyze each one:

### 1. Critical Issue: Planet Control Mapping (Line 851)

**Issue**: The current implementation filters out planets controlled by the eliminated player, but the mapping should retain all planets with `None` for uncontrolled planets.

**Current Code**:
```python
new_planet_control_mapping = {
    planet_name: controller
    for planet_name, controller in self.planet_control_mapping.items()
    if controller != player_id
}
```

**Suggested Fix**:
```python
new_planet_control_mapping = self.planet_control_mapping.copy()
for name, controller in list(new_planet_control_mapping.items()):
    if controller == player_id:
        new_planet_control_mapping[name] = None
```

**Analysis**: This is a good suggestion. The planet control mapping should maintain all planets but set eliminated players' control to None rather than removing them entirely.

### 2. Minor Issue: Trailing Whitespace (Line 1238)

**Issue**: Blank line contains whitespace that needs to be removed.

**Analysis**: This is a simple formatting issue that should be fixed.

### 3. Additional Issues from Review Summary

From the review summary, there are also comments about:
- Promissory notes hashing issues
- Equality robustness for hand order
- Player creation patterns

Let me examine the specific files and implement the necessary changes.

## Implementation Plan

1. Fix the planet control mapping logic in `game_state.py`
2. Remove trailing whitespace
3. Address any other formatting or logic issues
4. Run tests to ensure changes work correctly
5. Update this analysis with responses to each comment
