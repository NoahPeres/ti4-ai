"""
Template for implementing new technology abilities.

This template provides a standardized approach for implementing technology
abilities that follows the development guidelines and best practices.

USAGE:
1. Copy this template to the appropriate location
2. Get user confirmation for all specifications
3. Replace placeholder values with confirmed specifications
4. Implement the specific ability logic
5. Write comprehensive tests

IMPORTANT: Never implement without user confirmation of specifications!
