## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Technical Risks
1. **Integration Complexity**: Start with isolated implementations, then integrate
2. **Performance Issues**: Implement with performance monitoring from start
3. **Test Coverage**: Maintain 90%+ test coverage throughout development

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Focus strictly on identified critical gaps
2. **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize critical blockers over nice-to-have features
3. **Timeline Pressure**: Allow buffer time for integration and testing

### Quality Risks
1. **Regression Issues**: Comprehensive regression testing after each phase
2. **Type Safety**: Maintain strict mypy compliance throughout
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation concurrent with implementation

## MONITORING AND REPORTING
