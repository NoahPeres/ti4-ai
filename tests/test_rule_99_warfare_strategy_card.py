"""Tests for Rule 99: WARFARE (STRATEGY CARD) - Comprehensive LRR compliance verification.

This test file verifies that all sub-rules of Rule 99 are properly implemented:
- 99.1: STEP 1 - Remove command token from board and place in chosen pool
- 99.2: STEP 2 - Redistribute command tokens between pools
- 99.3: Secondary ability - Other players can spend strategy token for production
