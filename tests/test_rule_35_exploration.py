"""Test Rule 35: EXPLORATION

LRR 35: Planets and some space areas can be explored, yielding varying results
determined by the cards drawn from the exploration decks.

This module tests all aspects of the exploration system including:
- Planet exploration when gaining control (35.1)
- Trait-based exploration deck selection (35.2)
- Multiple exploration handling (35.3)
- Frontier token exploration (35.4-35.6)
- Card resolution mechanics (35.7)
- Attachment cards (35.8)
- Relic fragments (35.9)
