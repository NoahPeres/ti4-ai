"""
End-to-end integration tests for Rule 7: AGENDA CARDS system.

This module tests complete agenda phase workflows including:
- Law enactment and persistent effects across multiple rounds
- Directive execution and immediate effects
- Election mechanics with all card types
- Full integration with voting, game state, and other systems

Tests follow TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR methodology.

# REFACTOR PHASE CONSIDERATION:
# After implementing these tests and making them pass, consider:
# 1. **Code Duplication**: Extract common setup patterns into helper methods
# 2. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error scenarios and recovery testing
# 3. **Validation**: Ensure all edge cases are covered with proper validation
# 4. **Naming**: Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate what's being tested
# 5. **Single Responsibility**: Each test should focus on one specific workflow aspect
# 6. **Readability**: Add clear comments explaining complex test scenarios

# The tests are comprehensive but may need refactoring once implementation begins
# to eliminate duplication and improve maintainability. The current structure
# provides good coverage of all integration scenarios specified in the task.
