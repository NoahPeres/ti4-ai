"""Comprehensive system integration tests for Rule 81 Status Phase completion.

This module provides comprehensive integration testing that focuses specifically on
the requirements outlined in task 15.1: Write comprehensive integration tests.

This complements the existing comprehensive integration tests by focusing on:
- Integration with ALL existing game systems (Requirements 10.1-10.5)
- Complete round progression scenarios (Requirements 9.1-9.3)
- Phase transition validation (Requirements 9.1-9.3)

LRR References:
- Rule 81: Status Phase - Complete 8-step sequence
- Rule 27.4: Agenda phase activation after custodians token removal
- Rule 61: Objectives - Integration with scoring system
- Rule 83: Strategy Cards - Integration with card management
- Rule 20: Command Tokens - Integration with token management
- Rule 2: Action Cards - Integration with card drawing
- Rule 51: Leaders - Integration with leader system
