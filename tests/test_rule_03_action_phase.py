"""Test Rule 3: ACTION PHASE implementation.

This module tests the complete implementation of Rule 3 from the LRR,
covering turn order, action types, pass conditions, and phase completion.

Rule 3 Requirements:
- 3.1: Players take turns in initiative order performing one action
- 3.2: If a player cannot perform an action, they must pass
- 3.3: After passing, no further turns but can resolve secondary abilities
- 3.3c: Consecutive actions possible if others have passed
- 3.4: Cannot pass until strategic action of strategy card performed
- 3.4a: In 3-4 player games, must exhaust both strategy cards
- 3.5: After all players pass, proceed to status phase
