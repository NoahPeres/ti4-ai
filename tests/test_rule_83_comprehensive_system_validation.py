"""Comprehensive system validation and testing for Rule 83: Strategy Card system.

This test file implements task 15 from the Rule 83 implementation plan:
- Run full test suite to ensure no regressions in existing systems
- Validate integration with all existing strategy card implementations
- Test multi-player scenarios with different player counts
- Verify AI decision-making interfaces work correctly
- Create performance testing for strategy card operations

Requirements: 6.4, 7.1, 8.5, 9.4
