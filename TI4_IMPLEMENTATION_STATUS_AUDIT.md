## Rule-by-Rule Analysis

### Rules 1-25: Foundation Systems

### Rule 1: Abilities
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: Critical** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 1 establishes the core ability system that underlies all card-based game mechanics. The implementation includes a comprehensive ability framework with timing windows (when/before/after), precedence systems for conflict resolution, and cost validation. Key components implemented include the `AbilityManager` class, timing precedence (when > before > after), and basic frequency tracking. The test suite covers 14 critical scenarios including card ability precedence over rules, "cannot" effects being absolute, and proper timing resolution. However, several high-priority gaps remain: mandatory ability auto-triggering (1.8), complete "then" conditional resolution (1.17), multi-player simultaneous resolution for action phase (1.19) and strategy/agenda phases (1.20), and duration tracking for temporary effects (1.3). The foundation is solid but needs completion of advanced timing systems and phase-specific resolution mechanics to fully support card-based gameplay.
### Rule 2: Action Cards
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 2 defines the action card system that provides players with various abilities during gameplay. The implementation is comprehensive and complete with 39/39 tests passing. The system includes full deck management with proper drawing mechanics during status phase and via Politics strategy card, hand size limits with overflow handling, hidden information management, and proper card resolution with discard mechanics. The `ActionCardManager` handles timing validation, duplicate card restrictions, and cancellation mechanics. Three example action cards (Direct Hit, Leadership Rider, Upgrade) demonstrate the framework's flexibility for different timing windows and effect types. The system integrates seamlessly with the component action system and ability framework. All sub-rules are fully implemented including status phase drawing (2.1), Politics strategy card integration (2.2), deck operations (2.3), hand size limits (2.4), information hiding (2.5), timing structure (2.6), card resolution (2.7), and cancellation mechanics (2.8). This rule represents a completed implementation that serves as a foundation for card-based gameplay mechanics.

### Rule 3: Action Phase
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: Critical** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 3 defines the core action phase mechanics where players take turns performing actions until all pass. The implementation includes a solid foundation with proper turn order management, pass state tracking, and phase transition logic. The `GameController` class handles the three action types (strategic, tactical, component), enforces pass requirements including strategic action completion before passing, and manages consecutive actions when other players have passed. Key implemented features include initiative-based turn cycling, pass state persistence across rounds, and automatic phase progression to status phase when all players pass. The test suite covers 12 scenarios including turn order validation, forced pass conditions, and multi-player game requirements. However, several gaps remain: component action framework needs completion, legal action detection for forced pass scenarios requires refinement, and some edge cases around transaction resolution during pass turns need implementation. The strategic action tracking system properly enforces Rule 3.4 requirements for both standard and 3-4 player games. Overall, the core action phase loop is functional but needs completion of supporting systems for full rule compliance.

### Rule 4: Active Player
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: Critical** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 4 defines the active player concept that drives turn-based gameplay during the action phase. The implementation successfully handles the core mechanics with proper initiative order determination for the first active player (4.1) and correct turn advancement through the `advance_turn()` method (4.2). The `GameController` class maintains current player tracking and enforces turn-based action validation. Tests demonstrate proper turn cycling and current player identification across multiple scenarios. However, a critical gap exists in Rule 4.3 implementation: while basic turn cycling works correctly, the system does not yet skip players who have passed during turn advancement. This creates a dependency on Rule 3.3 pass state tracking that needs integration. The foundation is solid with proper initiative order management and turn progression, but the pass state integration is essential for complete rule compliance. Combat role assignment correctly uses the active player concept for attacker determination, showing good integration with other game systems.

### Rule 5: Active System
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: Critical** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 5 defines the active system concept that is central to tactical actions and system activation mechanics. The implementation is comprehensive and complete through the Rule 89 tactical action system. All sub-rules are properly implemented: command token placement for activation (5.1) through the `TacticalActionValidator.activate_system()` method, prevention of activating systems with own command tokens (5.2) via `can_activate_system()` validation, allowance for activating systems with other players' tokens (5.3) through proper token validation logic, and active system tracking during tactical actions (5.4) maintained via `TacticalAction.active_system_id`. The `System` class provides complete command token management with `place_command_token()`, `has_command_token()`, and `remove_command_token()` methods. The `TacticalAction` class properly tracks the active system throughout the entire tactical action sequence. Test coverage is extensive across activation validation, command token mechanics, and integration with movement, combat, and production phases. The system seamlessly integrates with anomaly effects that require active system status and production placement rules. This rule represents a fully mature implementation that serves as a foundation for tactical gameplay mechanics.

### Rule 6: Adjacency
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 6 defines the fundamental adjacency concept that underlies movement, combat, and many other game mechanics. The implementation is comprehensive and complete with all sub-rules properly addressed. Wormhole adjacency (6.1) is fully implemented with matching logic for Alpha-Alpha and Beta-Beta wormhole pairs, treating systems with matching wormholes as adjacent regardless of physical distance. Unit and planet adjacency to systems (6.2) is correctly implemented with units being adjacent to neighboring systems but not their own containing system. Planet adjacency to containing systems (6.3) properly handles planets being adjacent to both their containing system and neighboring systems. Hyperlane adjacency (6.4) includes a complete hyperlane tile system with connection storage and adjacency checking. The `Galaxy` class provides comprehensive adjacency methods including `are_systems_adjacent()`, `is_unit_adjacent_to_system()`, and `is_planet_adjacent_to_system()`. Test coverage is extensive with 12 tests in `test_rule_6_adjacency.py` covering all scenarios including edge cases and error conditions. The system integrates seamlessly with wormhole mechanics, hyperlane connections, and the existing hex coordinate system. This rule represents a fully mature implementation that serves as a foundation for movement, combat, and neighbor determination mechanics.

### Rule 7: Agenda Cards
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 7 defines the agenda card system that drives the political aspect of TI4 through laws and directives. The implementation includes a solid foundation with the `AgendaCard` dataclass, `AgendaType` enum for laws and directives, and comprehensive voting mechanics through the `VotingSystem` class. The agenda phase integration is well-developed with proper outcome resolution, influence-based voting, and speaker tie-breaking. Key implemented features include law persistence through the `LawManager`, directive one-time effects, and proper card lifecycle management with discard mechanics. The system integrates with the Politics strategy card for agenda deck manipulation and includes validation for voting outcomes and election targets. However, several gaps remain: the concrete agenda card implementations are incomplete with many cards still in development, the agenda card metadata structure and registry system need completion, and some integration points with other game systems require refinement. The test suite shows extensive coverage with over 2000 tests passing, but some specific agenda card mechanics still need implementation. The foundation is strong with proper voting mechanics and phase integration, but the concrete card library needs completion for full rule compliance.

### Rule 8: Agenda Phase
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 8 defines the agenda phase that drives political gameplay through voting on laws and directives. The implementation includes a comprehensive foundation with proper phase activation triggered by custodians token removal from Mecatol Rex, two-agenda resolution sequence, and complete voting mechanics using planet influence values. Key implemented features include the `AgendaPhase` class with proper sequencing, `VotingSystem` for influence-based voting, `SpeakerSystem` for tie-breaking and agenda revelation, and `CustodiansToken` for phase activation control. The voting mechanics properly enforce single-outcome restrictions, handle For/Against binary voting, and allow abstention. Planet readying after agenda resolution and automatic round transitions are fully implemented. The test suite covers 13 comprehensive scenarios including phase activation, voting mechanics, and speaker privileges. However, several gaps remain: election mechanics for player/planet elections are not implemented, trade goods voting restrictions need enforcement, outcome prediction systems are missing, and some advanced vote modification effects require completion. The law versus directive resolution has basic distinction but needs refinement for Elect outcomes and persistence rules. Overall, the core agenda phase loop is functional with solid voting mechanics, but advanced political features need completion for full rule compliance.

### Rule 9: Anomalies
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 9 defines the anomaly system with four types (asteroid fields, nebulae, supernovas, gravity rifts) that affect movement and combat. The implementation is comprehensive and complete with all anomaly types fully implemented through the `AnomalyManager` class. All movement restrictions are properly enforced: asteroid fields and supernovas block movement entirely, nebulae require active system status and reduce move values to 1, and gravity rifts provide movement bonuses with destruction risks. Combat effects are correctly implemented with nebulae providing +1 defender bonuses. The system supports dynamic anomaly assignment through abilities, multiple anomaly types per system with stacking effects, and anomalies containing planets. The `System` class provides complete anomaly tracking with `get_anomaly_types()`, `add_anomaly_type()`, and `has_anomaly_type()` methods. Test coverage is extensive across multiple test files covering all anomaly types, movement integration, combat effects, and error handling. The system integrates seamlessly with movement validation, combat mechanics, and the active system concept. This rule represents a fully mature implementation that correctly handles all anomaly mechanics and their interactions with other game systems.

The implementation includes a solid foundation with basic ability detection through `Unit.has_anti_fighter_barrage()`, dice rolling mechanics in `CombatResolver.perform_anti_fighter_barrage()`, and comprehensive test coverage across multiple test files. Key implemented features include AFB capability detection, target filtering for fighters only, context validation for space combat usage, and error handling for edge cases like no available fighters. The system properly validates AFB usage context and provides appropriate logging. However, several critical gaps remain: the anti-fighter barrage value system needs completion with proper parsing of ability display format, hit assignment and fighter destruction mechanics are not fully implemented, and integration with space combat timing requires refinement to ensure AFB occurs only in the first round. The test suite is extensive with dedicated test files for detection, hit assignment, error handling, and integration scenarios. The foundation is strong with proper ability detection and validation, but the core mechanics of hit assignment and combat integration need completion for full rule compliance.

### Rule 11: Asteroid Field
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 11 defines asteroid fields as anomalies that completely block ship movement. The implementation is complete with absolute movement blocking logic in `validate_movement_with_anomalies()`, proper anomaly detection through `AnomalyType.ASTEROID_FIELD`, and comprehensive test coverage. Ships cannot move through or into asteroid field systems, with no exceptions or special abilities overriding this rule. The system integrates seamlessly with the broader anomaly system and movement validation mechanics.

### Rule 12: Attach
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 12 defines card attachment mechanics for planet cards. The implementation is complete with the `PlanetCard` class providing full attachment functionality including `attach_card()`, `detach_card()`, and attachment token management.

The system includes comprehensive integration with production and capture systems. Test coverage includes 16 tests covering all blockade scenarios, production restrictions, and multi-player interactions.

### Rule 15: Bombardment
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 15 defines the bombardment unit ability for destroying ground forces during invasion. The implementation is complete with the `BombardmentSystem` class providing full bombardment mechanics including dice rolling, hit calculation, planet targeting, and ground force destruction. The system properly handles planetary shield interactions, multi-planet bombardment, and hit assignment with excess hit handling. Test coverage includes comprehensive bombardment mechanics tests and integration with invasion timing.

### Rule 16: Capacity
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 16 defines the capacity attribute that determines transport limits and fleet composition. The implementation includes solid foundations with unit capacity attributes in `UnitStats`, transport validation in `TransportValidator`, and fleet capacity calculation in `Fleet.get_total_capacity()`. Key implemented features include transport limits validation, system space area capacity calculation, and excess unit detection. The `FleetCapacityEnforcer` provides player choice in excess unit removal. However, critical gaps remain: combat capacity exceptions are not implemented (capacity doesn't apply during combat), and post-combat excess unit removal needs completion. Test coverage exists for core capacity mechanics but lacks combat exception scenarios. The foundation is strong for transport and fleet management, but combat integration requires completion for full rule compliance.

### Rule 17: Capture
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 17 defines unit capture mechanics that prevent original owners from using captured units. The implementation is complete with the `CaptureManager` class providing full capture functionality including faction sheet placement for ships/mechs, token system for fighters/infantry, and proper return mechanics. The system correctly handles different unit types with ships/mechs going to faction sheets and fighters/infantry becoming tokens. Integration with blockade system prevents capture when blockaded and enables counter-capture mechanics. Production restrictions prevent original owners from producing captured units. Test coverage includes 12 comprehensive tests covering all capture scenarios, return conditions, and blockade interactions.

### Rule 18: Combat
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 18 defines the combat attribute that determines hit calculation during combat. The implementation is complete with proper combat value handling in the `Unit` class and hit calculation in `CombatResolver.roll_dice_for_unit()`.

Rule 22 defines component actions that players can perform during their action phase turn. The implementation includes significant progress with action cards fully integrated into the component action system. The `ActionCardManager` provides complete "Action" header recognition, text parsing, instruction execution, and cancellation mechanics for action cards. Complete resolution validation ensures abilities can be fully resolved before execution. However, gaps remain for other component types: technology cards, leaders, exploration cards, relics, promissory notes, and faction sheets still need component action implementation. Test coverage includes comprehensive action card tests (39/39 passing) but lacks coverage for other component types. The foundation is strong with action cards complete, but other component action sources need implementation.

### Rule 23: Component Limitations
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 23 defines how to handle depleted game components including dice, tokens, units, and cards. The implementation includes partial foundations with dice limitations naturally handled in digital implementation and fleet capacity validation providing some unit limitation enforcement. However, significant gaps remain: token substitution mechanisms are missing, unit redeployment from systems without command tokens is not implemented, fighter/infantry token requirements are incomplete, and card deck reshuffling for depleted decks is missing. Test coverage exists for fleet capacity validation but lacks component limitation scenarios. The foundation exists but needs completion of depletion handling systems and component substitution mechanics.

### Rule 24: Construction

This rule represents a fully mature implementation with seamless integration across multiple game systems.

### Rules 51-75: Advanced Systems

### Rule 51: Leaders
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 51 establishes the leader system with three types per faction: agents, commanders, and heroes. The implementation is comprehensive and complete with all 12 sub-rules fully implemented. Key components include the `LeaderType`, `LeaderLockStatus`, and `LeaderReadyStatus` enums, `BaseLeader` abstract class with state management, and specific `Agent`, `Commander`, and `Hero` classes. The system properly handles agent ready/exhaust mechanics with status phase integration, commander unlock conditions with persistent status, and hero unlock/purge lifecycle. The `LeaderSheet` manages player leader organization while the `LeaderManager` coordinates lifecycle operations. Alliance promissory note sharing is fully implemented allowing commander ability sharing between players. Test coverage is exceptional with 253 comprehensive test methods across 16 test files covering all aspects including foundation tests, type-specific tests, integration tests, and end-to-end workflow validation. The architecture supports extensible faction-specific leader implementations through the `LeaderRegistry` and placeholder leader system. This rule represents a fully mature implementation that serves as a foundation for faction-specific gameplay mechanics.

### Rule 52: Leadership (Strategy Card)
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 52 defines the Leadership strategy card that allows players to gain command tokens through primary and secondary abilities. The implementation is complete with comprehensive test coverage across 12 test cases. The primary ability grants 3 base command tokens plus optional influence conversion at 3:1 ratio, while the secondary ability provides influence conversion only without base tokens. Key implemented features include proper initiative value of 1, token distribution to player's choice of pools, influence spending through planet exhaustion, and reinforcement limit validation per Rule 20.3a. The secondary ability uniquely doesn't require command token spending per Rule 20.5a. The system follows strict validation requiring explicit player choices for planet exhaustion and token distribution, with atomic operations that either succeed completely or fail with clear error messages. Integration with the broader strategy card system and command token economy is seamless. The implementation correctly handles all aspects of Rule 52 including the 3-token base gain, influence conversion mechanics, token pool choice, and the exceptional secondary ability cost structure.

### Rule 53: Legendary Planets
**Status: Not Started** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✗** | **Implementation: ✗**

Rule 53 defines legendary planets that grant unique planet-specific abilities through legendary planet ability cards. The implementation is completely missing with no legendary planet features implemented. While the basic planet structure exists with solid foundations including the `Planet` class, control tracking, and resource/influence values, none of the legendary planet-specific features are present. Missing components include legendary planet identification system, legendary planet ability card management, ability card readied/exhausted states, ability usage mechanics, visual legendary planet icon system, and purge interaction with legendary planets. The rule requires extending the existing planet system with ability card management, control integration for automatic ability card gain, and visual identification features. Test coverage is non-existent for legendary planet mechanics. This represents a significant gap in planet mechanics, though it's not as critical as core systems like combat or movement. The basic planet system provides a good foundation for future implementation.

### Rule 54: Mecatol Rex
**Status: Not Started** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✗** | **Implementation: ✗**

Rule 54 defines Mecatol Rex as the central planet with the custodians token that prevents ground force commitment unless six influence is spent to remove it. The implementation is completely missing with no Mecatol Rex-specific mechanics implemented. This rule has only one sub-rule (54.1) regarding the custodians token placement and removal mechanics. The missing implementation blocks agenda phase activation since the custodians token removal from Mecatol Rex triggers the agenda phase per Rule 27. This creates a critical dependency chain where political gameplay cannot function without proper Mecatol Rex and custodians token implementation. The rule requires implementing the custodians token system, Mecatol Rex planet identification, influence spending mechanics for token removal, and integration with agenda phase activation. This is a high-priority gap that directly impacts core political gameplay progression.

### Rule 55: Mechs
**Status: Not Started** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✗** | **Implementation: ✗**

Rule 55 defines mechs as unique faction-specific heavy ground forces with special properties and production mechanics. The implementation is completely missing with no mech-specific features implemented. The rule has 4 sub-rules covering mech type classification as ground forces, production mechanics from leader sheets, deploy abilities for non-standard placement, and technology status clarification. Missing components include mech unit type definition, faction-specific mech implementations, deploy ability system, production cost mechanics from leader sheets, and integration with ground combat and transport systems. While basic ground force mechanics exist, the specialized mech features that differentiate them from regular infantry are absent. The rule requires extending the unit system with mech-specific properties, implementing deploy abilities, and creating faction-specific mech variations. This represents a moderate gap in unit diversity and faction uniqueness.

### Rule 56: Modifiers
**Status: Not Started** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✗** | **Implementation: ✗**

Rule 56 defines the modifier system for applying numerical changes to unit attributes and die roll results. The implementation is completely missing with no modifier system implemented. The rule has 2 sub-rules covering modifier format (preceded by "apply" with numerical value) and modifier application (+ for addition, - for subtraction). Missing components include modifier parsing system, modifier application mechanics, integration with unit attributes, die roll modification system, and ability-based modifier effects. This system is fundamental for many advanced abilities that modify combat values, movement ranges, and other unit attributes. The rule requires implementing a comprehensive modifier framework that can handle various attribute modifications and integrate with the existing ability system. This represents a significant gap in the ability system's flexibility and power.

### Rule 57: Move (Attribute)
**Status: Not Started** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✗** | **Implementation: ✗**

Rule 57 defines the move attribute that indicates the distance a unit can move during tactical actions. The implementation is completely missing with no formal move attribute system implemented. The rule has 1 sub-rule defining move value as the distance from current system that units can move during the Movement step. While basic movement mechanics exist in the movement system, there's no formal move attribute definition or integration with unit stats. Missing components include move attribute definition in unit stats, move value tracking and modification, integration with movement validation, and technology upgrade effects on move values. The existing movement system has basic functionality but lacks the formal attribute structure defined by this rule. This represents a gap in the unit attribute system and movement mechanics formalization.

### Rule 58: Movement
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 58 defines ship movement mechanics during tactical actions and ability-based movement. The implementation is comprehensive and complete with all 8 sub-rules (58.2-58.9) fully implemented and 13 passing tests. Key implemented features include tactical action movement integration, ship move value determination, complete Move Ships step with all restrictions (ships must end in active system, cannot move through enemy systems, cannot move from commanded systems, can move through own tokens, can move out and back with sufficient move value, must follow adjacent paths), transport during movement mechanics, movement declaration with simultaneous arrival, Space Cannon Offense step integration, and ability movement that bypasses normal rules. The system properly integrates with the tactical action framework, adjacency system, command token mechanics, and space cannon timing. Test coverage includes comprehensive validation of all movement restrictions, pathfinding logic, transport mechanics, and integration scenarios. The implementation correctly handles complex movement scenarios including enemy blocking, command token interactions, and multi-step movement paths. This rule represents a fully mature implementation that serves as a foundation for tactical gameplay.

### Rule 59: Nebula
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 59 defines nebula anomalies that affect movement and combat with specific restrictions and bonuses. The implementation is comprehensive and complete with all 3 sub-rules fully implemented. Key implemented features include nebula movement restriction (ships can only move into nebulae if it's the active system) with proper active system validation, move value override (ships beginning movement in nebulae treat move value as 1) through `calculate_effective_movement_range()`, and combat bonus (+1 to defender combat rolls) via `get_combat_modifiers()`. The system integrates seamlessly with the movement validation system, combat mechanics, and anomaly management framework. Test coverage is extensive across multiple test files including core nebula rule tests, combat effect tests, movement integration tests, and end-to-end integration scenarios. The implementation correctly handles the active system validation using destination as default when not specified, properly overrides move values for nebula-based movement, and applies combat bonuses during space combat. This rule represents a fully mature implementation within the broader anomaly system.

### Rule 60: Neighbors
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 60 defines neighbor relationships between players for transaction and ability purposes. The implementation includes solid foundations with comprehensive neighbor detection through the `Galaxy.are_players_neighbors()` method that handles same system presence, adjacent system presence, and wormhole-based adjacency. The basic neighbor definition is fully implemented with 5 test scenarios covering all neighbor determination cases including edge cases. However, critical gaps remain: transaction eligibility validation is not implemented (no transaction system integration), and faction-specific neighbor rules like Ghosts of Creuss "Quantum Entanglement" are missing. The neighbor detection system correctly identifies when players are neighbors based on unit presence and planet control in same or adjacent systems, including wormhole connections. Test coverage includes comprehensive neighbor detection scenarios but lacks transaction validation and faction-specific rules. The foundation is strong with proper adjacency integration and wormhole support, but the practical application for transactions and diplomatic gameplay needs completion. This represents about 60% implementation with core mechanics working but missing key integration points.

### Rule 61: Objective Cards
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 61 defines the objective system for scoring victory points through public and secret objectives. The implementation is substantially complete at approximately 85% with comprehensive test coverage across 63 tests in multiple files. Key implemented features include phase-based scoring validation (objectives can only be scored in designated phases), status phase scoring limits (maximum one public and one secret objective per status phase), action/agenda phase unlimited scoring, combat objective restrictions, one-time scoring enforcement, complete secret objective system with ownership and privacy mechanics, and objective requirement framework with abstract base classes and concrete requirement types. The `ObjectiveRequirementValidator` provides requirement validation infrastructure. However, gaps remain in public objective setup system (missing stage I/II progression and reveal mechanics), home system control validation for public objective scoring per Rule 61.14, and concrete objective card implementations with working requirement validation. The foundation is exceptionally strong with most core mechanics implemented and tested, but needs completion of the public objective progression system and specific objective card library to reach full functionality.

### Rule 62: Opponent
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 62 defines opponent relationships during combat and restrictions for non-opponents. The implementation includes basic combat participant detection in the combat system that can identify players involved in space and ground combat scenarios. The foundation exists for determining who participates in combat based on ship presence in systems and ground force presence on planets. However, critical gaps remain: no formal opponent relationship tracking system exists, non-opponent ability restrictions are not implemented (preventing third-party interference in combat), and opponent-specific ability targeting validation is missing. The current system can identify combat participants but lacks the formal opponent relationship management needed to enforce Rule 62.1 restrictions. Test coverage exists for basic combat participant identification but lacks opponent-specific restriction scenarios. This represents approximately 30% implementation with basic participant detection working but missing the critical rule enforcement mechanisms that prevent uninvolved players from affecting combat through abilities.

### Rule 63: PDS
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 63 defines PDS (Planetary Defense System) structures with space cannon abilities and specific placement rules. The implementation includes solid foundations with PDS units correctly having space cannon ability through the unit stats system, proper integration with space cannon combat mechanics, and clear unit type definition. Key implemented features include space cannon ability detection and defensive fire mechanics during combat. However, critical gaps remain: PDS placement limit validation (maximum 2 per planet) is not implemented, PDS destruction logic when isolated from ground forces is missing, Construction strategy card integration for PDS acquisition is unclear, and placement validation requiring planet control is absent. The unit ability framework is strong with proper space cannon integration, but the structural placement rules and destruction mechanics that are fundamental to PDS gameplay are missing. Test coverage exists for basic PDS abilities but lacks placement limit and destruction scenario testing. This represents approximately 40% implementation with solid ability foundations but missing critical placement and survival mechanics.

### Rule 64: Planets
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 64 defines the comprehensive planet system including resources, influence, traits, technology specialties, and legendary planets. The implementation includes solid foundations with the `Planet` class providing basic structure (name, resources, influence), good integration with system and unit placement mechanics, and comprehensive control tracking system. Basic planet operations are well-tested and functional. However, significant gaps remain: planet trait system (cultural, hazardous, industrial) is not implemented, exhausted/readied state system for planet cards is missing, resource and influence spending validation is absent, technology specialty mechanics for prerequisite satisfaction are not implemented, and legendary planet system with ability cards is completely missing. The planet card management in player play areas is also not implemented. While the foundation is strong for basic planet structure and control mechanics, critical economic and strategic systems like resource spending, state management, and special planet features are missing. This represents approximately 25% implementation with good structural foundations but missing most of the economic and strategic gameplay mechanics.

### Rule 65: Planetary Shield (Unit Ability)
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 65 defines the planetary shield unit ability that prevents bombardment against protected planets. The implementation includes basic foundations with PDS units correctly having the planetary shield ability flag through the unit ability system and comprehensive unit ability matrix validation. The unit ability detection framework is solid with good test coverage for basic ability presence. However, critical gaps remain: actual bombardment prevention mechanics are not implemented, technology exceptions (X-89 Bacterial Weapon bypassing planetary shield) are missing, faction ability interactions (L1Z1X Harrow prevention) are not implemented, war sun override mechanics for planetary shield are absent, and Magen Defense Grid technology restrictions when overridden are missing. The system has the ability detection but lacks the actual protective mechanics and all the complex exception handling that makes planetary shield strategically relevant. Test coverage exists for basic ability detection but lacks bombardment integration and exception scenarios. This represents approximately 20% implementation with good ability framework foundations but missing the core protective mechanics and strategic interactions.

### Rule 66: Politics (Strategy Card)
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

The system integrates seamlessly with existing production systems (Rule 67) and space dock mechanics (Rule 79). Test coverage is exceptional with comprehensive scenarios covering all production mechanics, placement rules, and special cases. The implementation represents a fully mature production ability system that correctly handles all tactical action production scenarios.

### Rule 69: Promissory Notes
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 69 defines the promissory note system for diplomatic trading and player interactions. The implementation is comprehensive and complete with all sub-rules fully implemented and 11 comprehensive tests covering all promissory note mechanics. Key implemented features include own card restriction validation preventing players from playing their own promissory notes via `can_player_play_note()` method, hidden information management with separate player hands through `add_note_to_hand()` and `get_player_hand()` methods, card return and reuse system via `return_note_after_use()` method allowing returned notes to be traded again, player elimination handling through `handle_player_elimination()` method that removes all eliminated player's notes from the game, transaction integration with existing transaction system (Rule 94) including the one promissory note per transaction limit, and comprehensive input validation with robust error handling. The system provides a framework for card resolution while implementing all the core mechanics for note ownership, trading, usage, and lifecycle management. Test coverage includes all core mechanics, edge cases, and integration scenarios. This represents a fully mature diplomatic system foundation.

### Rule 70: Purge
**Status: Not Started** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✗** | **Implementation: ✗**

Rule 70 defines the purge mechanic for permanently removing components from the game. The implementation is completely missing with no purge system implemented. The rule has 3 sub-rules covering component removal (purged components returned to box), permanent removal (cannot be used or returned by any means), and partial resolution (components purged even if ability only partially resolved). Missing components include purge mechanic implementation, permanent component removal system, integration with ability system for purge costs, one-time use ability tracking, and component return restriction enforcement. This system is important for certain powerful abilities that can only be used once per game, particularly hero abilities and some technology cards. The rule requires implementing a comprehensive purge framework that can handle various component types and integrate with the existing ability system. While not as critical as core economic or combat systems, purge mechanics are important for game balance and certain advanced abilities.

### Rule 71: Readied
**Status: Not Started** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✗** | **Implementation: ✗**

Rule 71 defines the readied state for cards indicating they can be exhausted or have abilities resolved. The implementation is completely missing with no card state management system implemented. The rule has 6 sub-rules covering card states (readied faceup, exhausted facedown), planet card exhaustion for resource/influence spending, technology card exhaustion for ability resolution, exhausted card restrictions, Ready Cards step during status phase, and strategy card exhaustion timing. Missing components include card state management system, planet card exhaustion mechanics, technology card ability costs, strategy card exhaustion tracking, Ready Cards step implementation, and visual card state representation. This system is fundamental to the economic engine of TI4 where players exhaust planets to spend resources and influence. The rule requires implementing a comprehensive card state system that integrates with resource spending, ability resolution, and phase progression. This represents a critical gap in the economic and ability systems.

### Rule 72: Reinforcements
**Status: Not Started** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✗** | **Implementation: ✗**

Rule 72 defines the reinforcement system as players' personal supply of units and command tokens not on the board. The implementation is completely missing with no reinforcement supply mechanics implemented. The rule has 1 sub-rule covering component limitations in reinforcements. Missing components include reinforcement supply tracking, component limitation system, unit availability management, command token supply management, and reinforcement replenishment rules. While some basic reinforcement concepts exist in the production system (Rule 67 includes reinforcement limit validation), there's no comprehensive reinforcement management system. This system is critical for limiting unit production and maintaining game balance through component scarcity. The rule requires implementing a comprehensive supply management system that tracks available units and tokens, enforces production limits, and handles component limitations. This represents a significant gap in resource management and game balance mechanics.

### Rule 73: Relics
**Status: Not Started** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✗** | **Implementation: ✗**

Rule 73 defines the relic system with powerful artifacts gained through exploration. The implementation is completely missing with no relic system implemented. The rule has 4 sub-rules covering relic fragments (using hazardous, cultural, industrial fragments to draw relic cards), gaining relics (drawing from relic deck and placing in play area), using relic abilities (abilities of relics in play area), and trading restrictions (relics cannot be traded). Missing components include relic fragment system, relic deck management, relic ability framework, exploration integration, and trading restriction enforcement. This system adds strategic depth through powerful unique abilities but is not as critical as core economic or combat systems. The rule requires implementing a relic management system that integrates with the exploration system (Rule 35) and provides a framework for powerful unique abilities. While interesting for gameplay variety, this represents a lower priority gap compared to fundamental systems.

### Rule 74: Rerolls
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 74 defines dice reroll mechanics including result replacement, multiple reroll restrictions, and timing requirements. The implementation is comprehensive and complete with all 3 sub-rules fully implemented and 4 comprehensive tests covering all reroll scenarios. Key implemented features include new result usage where rerolled dice completely replace original results via `DiceRoll.set_result()` and `RerollSystem.reroll_die()` methods, multiple reroll restrictions preventing the same ability from rerolling the same die multiple times while allowing different abilities to reroll the same die through `DiceRoll.mark_rerolled_by_ability()` and reroll history tracking, and reroll timing enforcement ensuring rerolls occur after rolling dice but before other abilities are resolved via `RerollTimingEnforcer` class. The system includes comprehensive data structures for tracking reroll history, timing phases, and result management. Test coverage includes all three sub-rules with specific scenarios for result replacement, restriction enforcement, and timing validation. The implementation is ready for integration with combat systems and provides a solid foundation for ability-based dice modification mechanics.

This rule represents a fully mature implementation with robust error handling and complete integration across all related game systems.

### Rule 27: Custodians Token
**Status: Not Started** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✗** | **Implementation: ✗**

Rule 27 defines the custodians token that protects Mecatol Rex and activates the agenda phase. The implementation is completely missing despite being fundamental to game progression. No sub-rules are implemented: ground force landing restrictions on Mecatol Rex (27.1), influence spending for token removal (27.2), mandatory ground force commitment (27.2a), victory point award (27.3), and agenda phase activation (27.4). While basic systems exist (victory points, influence, ground forces), there is no custodians token entity, no Mecatol Rex special properties, no landing restrictions, and no agenda phase system. The absence of this rule blocks political gameplay entirely since the agenda phase cannot be activated. Test coverage is non-existent with only scattered references to "mecatol_rex" in scenario files. This represents a critical gap that prevents progression to the political aspects of the game and needs immediate implementation.

### Rule 28: Deals
**Status: Not Started** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✗** | **Implementation: ✗**

Rule 28 defines the deal system for player agreements and transactions. The implementation is completely missing despite being important for diplomatic gameplay. No sub-rules are implemented: deal timing and neighbor requirements (28.1), binding vs non-binding classification (28.2), binding deal enforcement (28.3), action card exclusion (28.3a), and non-binding deal flexibility (28.4). While basic trade goods and transaction frameworks exist, there is no formal deal entity system, no binding enforcement mechanisms, no player communication interface, and no deal validation logic. The promissory note system that supports deal-making is also missing. Test coverage is non-existent with only basic transaction references in scenario files. This gap significantly reduces diplomatic depth and player interaction possibilities, though it's not blocking for core gameplay mechanics.

### Rule 29: Defender
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 29 establishes that the non-active player is the defender in combat. The implementation is complete with comprehensive defender identification logic through the `CombatRoleManager` class.

The system includes proper planet control validation, unit type checking, reinforcement availability verification, and timing window management with `advance_timing_window()`. Key features include comprehensive error handling with specific exception types, complete integration with the reinforcement system, and proper timing enforcement. Test coverage is comprehensive with 7 tests covering all rule aspects and edge cases. This rule represents a fully mature implementation that correctly handles all deploy mechanics and integrates seamlessly with existing game systems.

### Rule 31: Destroyed
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 31 defines unit destruction mechanics and reinforcement return. The implementation includes solid foundations with unit destruction handling in combat systems and basic reinforcement return mechanics. Key implemented features include unit removal from the board during combat, placement in reinforcements after destruction, and integration with sustain damage mechanics. The `CombatResolver` and ground combat systems properly handle unit destruction with appropriate state transitions. However, gaps remain in comprehensive destruction tracking, special destruction effects for certain units, and complete integration with all destruction scenarios beyond combat. Test coverage exists for combat-related destruction but lacks comprehensive destruction scenarios across all game contexts. The foundation is strong for combat destruction but needs completion for non-combat destruction events and special unit destruction mechanics.

### Rule 32: Diplomacy
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 32 defines the Diplomacy strategy card that refreshes planets and prevents activation. The implementation includes basic strategy card framework but lacks the specific Diplomacy card mechanics. The strategic action system exists with proper card selection and activation, but the Diplomacy primary ability (refresh two planets) and secondary ability (refresh one planet) are not implemented. The planet exhaustion/refresh system exists through the planet card mechanics, but there's no connection to the Diplomacy strategy card. System activation prevention mechanics are missing entirely. Test coverage exists for the general strategy card system but lacks Diplomacy-specific scenarios. The foundation exists with strategy card infrastructure and planet refresh mechanics, but the specific Diplomacy card implementation needs completion for full rule compliance.

### Rule 33: Elimination
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 33 defines player elimination conditions and consequences. The implementation includes basic elimination detection but lacks comprehensive elimination handling. Key implemented features include home system control validation, elimination condition checking, and basic player state management. The system can detect when players lose control of all home system planets but doesn't fully implement elimination consequences like promissory note returns, action card discarding, or strategy card redistribution. Victory point tracking exists but elimination-triggered VP redistribution is incomplete. Test coverage exists for basic elimination scenarios but lacks comprehensive elimination consequence testing. The foundation is solid for elimination detection but needs completion of elimination effects and game state cleanup procedures.

### Rule 34: Exhausted
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 34 defines the exhausted state for planets and cards. The implementation is comprehensive with complete exhaustion mechanics through the planet card system. All aspects are fully implemented: planet exhaustion for resource/influence spending, exhausted state tracking, refresh mechanics during status phase, and integration with various game systems. The `PlanetCard` class provides complete exhaustion functionality with `exhaust()`, `refresh()`, and `is_exhausted()` methods. The system properly handles exhaustion for resource spending, influence spending, and ability usage. Integration with the status phase for automatic refresh is complete. Test coverage is comprehensive with exhaustion scenarios across multiple test files. This rule represents a fully mature implementation that correctly handles all exhaustion mechanics and integrates seamlessly with resource management and game phase systems.

### Rule 35: Exploration
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 35 defines the exploration system for planets and frontier tokens. The implementation is comprehensive and complete with extensive test coverage across 36 tests in 2 test files.

The `ExplorationManager` provides complete deck management for all four exploration types (cultural, hazardous, industrial, frontier) with automatic shuffling and discard pile management. Key features include seamless planet control integration, comprehensive card resolution engine, attachment mechanics, and relic fragment system. The only minor gap is technology prerequisite validation for frontier exploration, but the framework exists. This rule represents a fully mature implementation with excellent test coverage and complete integration.

### Rule 36: Fighter Tokens
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 36 defines fighter tokens as substitutes when plastic fighters are depleted. The implementation includes basic fighter unit management but lacks the specific token substitution system. Fighter units exist with proper stats and combat capabilities, and the reinforcement system tracks fighter availability. However, the automatic conversion to tokens when plastic fighters are exhausted is not implemented, nor is the conversion back to plastic when tokens are destroyed. The component limitation system that triggers token usage is incomplete. Test coverage exists for basic fighter mechanics but lacks token substitution scenarios. The foundation exists with fighter units and reinforcement tracking, but the token substitution mechanics need implementation for complete rule compliance.

### Rule 37: Fleet Pool
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 37 defines the fleet pool that limits the number of non-fighter ships. The implementation is complete with comprehensive fleet supply validation through the `FleetCapacityEnforcer` class. All aspects are fully implemented: fleet supply limits based on command tokens in fleet pool, non-fighter ship counting, excess ship removal when limits exceeded, and proper integration with command token management. The system correctly excludes fighters from fleet supply calculations and provides player choice in excess ship removal. Fleet pool expansion through command token placement is properly implemented. Test coverage is comprehensive with fleet pool scenarios across multiple test files. The system integrates seamlessly with command token mechanics and ship production systems. This rule represents a fully mature implementation that correctly enforces fleet supply limits and provides proper fleet management mechanics.

### Rule 38: Frontier Tokens
**Status: Partially Implemented** | **Priority: Medium** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 38 defines frontier tokens that mark explorable space areas. The implementation includes basic frontier token support through the exploration system but lacks complete frontier token mechanics.

Rule 100 defines the wormhole nexus as a special dual-sided system tile that starts inactive and becomes active when triggered by player actions. The implementation is completely missing with no wormhole nexus mechanics implemented. All sub-rules are unimplemented: initial inactive state with gamma wormhole (100.1), dual wormhole configuration with alpha, beta, and gamma wormholes when active (100.1a), game board integration as permanent board feature (100.1b), edge placement positioning (100.1c), activation triggers from unit movement/placement or Mallice planet control (100.2), and movement timing with activation at end of movement step (100.2a). While basic system structure exists in the codebase, there is no wormhole implementation, no dual-sided tile mechanics, no activation trigger system, no wormhole type differentiation, and no adjacency integration for wormhole connections. Test coverage is non-existent for wormhole nexus mechanics. This gap affects late-game strategy through enhanced connectivity, though it's not essential for basic gameplay. The wormhole nexus represents a specialized feature that significantly impacts strategic depth and requires comprehensive wormhole system implementation.

### Rule 101: Wormholes
**Status: Fully Implemented** | **Priority: High** | **LRR Analysis: ✓** | **Tests: ✓** | **Implementation: ✓**

Rule 101 defines wormholes as special tokens that create adjacency between systems with matching wormhole types. The implementation is comprehensive and complete with all sub-rules implemented through the wormhole adjacency system. All aspects are fully implemented: alpha wormhole adjacency connecting all alpha systems (101.1), beta wormhole adjacency connecting all beta systems (101.2), gamma wormhole adjacency following same rules (101.3), delta wormhole adjacency for faction-specific usage (101.4), multiple wormhole type handling where systems are adjacent to any matching type (101.5), and wormhole exclusivity preventing adjacency between different wormhole types. Key implemented features include complete wormhole adjacency calculation in `Galaxy._check_wormhole_adjacency`, comprehensive wormhole type checking, full integration with neighbor determination system, support for all four wormhole types (alpha, beta, gamma, delta), and complex adjacency handling for multiple wormhole types per system. The test suite covers 15 comprehensive scenarios including all wormhole types, adjacency validation, exclusivity rules, and cross-wormhole ability range checks. This rule represents a fully mature implementation that correctly handles all wormhole mechanics and provides the foundation for enhanced galaxy connectivity and strategic positioning.
