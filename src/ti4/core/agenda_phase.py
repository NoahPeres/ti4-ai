Agenda Phase Implementation for TI4 AI

This module implements Rule 8: AGENDA PHASE mechanics according to the LRR.

Key Components:
- AgendaPhase: Main phase controller
- VotingSystem: Handles voting mechanics and influence calculation
- AgendaCard: Represents agenda cards (laws and directives)
- CustodiansToken: Tracks custodians token state
- SpeakerSystem: Manages speaker privileges and tie-breaking
