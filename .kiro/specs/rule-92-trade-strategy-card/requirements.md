# Requirements Document - Rule 92: Trade Strategy Card

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Rule 92: Trade Strategy Card according to the TI4 Living Rules Reference (LRR). The Trade strategy card is a critical component of the economic system that allows players to gain trade goods and replenish commodities. This implementation is identified as a **CRITICAL BLOCKER** in the implementation roadmap, as it represents an essential economic strategy option that's currently missing from the game.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Trade Strategy Card Basic Properties

**User Story:** As a player, I want the Trade strategy card to have the correct initiative value and card type, so that it integrates properly with the strategy card system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Trade strategy card is created THEN it SHALL have initiative value 5
2. WHEN the Trade strategy card type is requested THEN it SHALL return StrategyCardType.TRADE
3. WHEN the Trade strategy card is registered THEN it SHALL be available in the strategy card selection phase

### Requirement 2: Primary Ability - Gain Trade Goods

**User Story:** As the active player with the Trade strategy card, I want to gain 3 trade goods when executing the primary ability, so that I can increase my economic resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the active player executes the Trade primary ability THEN they SHALL gain 3 trade goods
2. WHEN the player has insufficient trade good capacity THEN the system SHALL handle overflow appropriately
3. WHEN the trade good gain is processed THEN the player's trade good count SHALL be updated in the game state

### Requirement 3: Primary Ability - Replenish Commodities

**User Story:** As the active player with the Trade strategy card, I want to replenish my commodities to my faction maximum when executing the primary ability, so that I can maximize my trading potential.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the active player executes the Trade primary ability THEN they SHALL replenish commodities to their faction maximum
2. WHEN the player already has maximum commodities THEN no additional commodities SHALL be gained
3. WHEN the commodity replenishment is processed THEN the player's commodity count SHALL equal their faction's commodity limit

### Requirement 4: Primary Ability - Choose Players for Free Secondary

**User Story:** As the active player with the Trade strategy card, I want to choose other players who can use the secondary ability without spending a command token, so that I can provide strategic benefits to allies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the active player executes the Trade primary ability THEN they SHALL be able to choose any number of other players
2. WHEN players are chosen THEN those players SHALL be able to use the secondary ability without command token cost
3. WHEN no players are chosen THEN all other players SHALL still be able to use the secondary ability with normal command token cost

### Requirement 5: Secondary Ability - Commodity Replenishment

**User Story:** As a non-active player, I want to spend a command token to replenish my commodities using the Trade secondary ability, so that I can benefit from the Trade strategy card.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a non-active player uses the Trade secondary ability THEN they SHALL spend 1 command token from their strategy pool
2. WHEN the command token is spent THEN the player SHALL replenish commodities to their faction maximum
3. WHEN the player has insufficient command tokens THEN the secondary ability SHALL not be available
4. WHEN the player was chosen by the active player THEN they SHALL replenish commodities without spending a command token

### Requirement 6: Integration with Strategy Card System

**User Story:** As a game system, I want the Trade strategy card to integrate seamlessly with the existing strategy card framework, so that it works consistently with other strategy cards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Trade strategy card is executed THEN it SHALL follow the standard strategy card execution pattern
2. WHEN the Trade strategy card abilities are resolved THEN they SHALL return proper StrategyCardAbilityResult objects
3. WHEN the Trade strategy card is used THEN it SHALL integrate with the strategy card coordinator
4. WHEN errors occur during execution THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 7: Resource Management Integration

**User Story:** As a game system, I want the Trade strategy card to properly integrate with the resource management system, so that trade goods and commodities are tracked accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trade goods are gained THEN they SHALL be tracked in the player's resource pool
2. WHEN commodities are replenished THEN they SHALL respect faction-specific commodity limits
3. WHEN command tokens are spent THEN they SHALL be properly deducted from the strategy pool
4. WHEN resource changes occur THEN they SHALL be reflected in the game state immediately

### Requirement 8: Multi-Player Support

**User Story:** As a game system, I want the Trade strategy card to support multi-player interactions, so that all players can participate in the economic benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple players use the secondary ability THEN each SHALL be processed independently
2. WHEN the active player chooses players for free secondary THEN the selection SHALL be tracked per execution
3. WHEN players have different faction commodity limits THEN each SHALL replenish to their own maximum
4. WHEN command token availability varies by player THEN each player's ability to use secondary SHALL be validated independently

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a game system, I want the Trade strategy card to handle edge cases and errors gracefully, so that the game remains stable and provides clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid player IDs are provided THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be returned
2. WHEN game state is corrupted or missing THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN resource limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate caps or overflow handling
4. WHEN concurrent access occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Tracking Updates

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all relevant documentation to be updated when the Trade strategy card is implemented, so that project tracking and analysis remain accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Trade strategy card implementation is complete THEN the LRR analysis file (.trae/lrr_analysis/92_trade_strategy_card.md) SHALL be updated with implementation status
2. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN the IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md SHALL be updated to reflect Rule 92 completion
3. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN the CRITICAL_PATH_IMPLEMENTATION_SEQUENCE.md SHALL be updated with progress
4. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN any other relevant tracking documents SHALL be updated

### Requirement 11: Performance and Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a game system, I want the Trade strategy card to meet performance and quality standards, so that it provides a smooth gameplay experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Trade strategy card is executed THEN it SHALL complete within 50ms
2. WHEN the implementation is tested THEN it SHALL achieve 95%+ test coverage
3. WHEN the code is analyzed THEN it SHALL pass all type checking and linting requirements
4. WHEN the system is integrated THEN it SHALL not degrade overall game performance
