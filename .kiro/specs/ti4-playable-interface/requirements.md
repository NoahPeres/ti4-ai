# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project focuses on creating playable interfaces for the TI4 framework, transforming the robust game engine into an actually playable game. Building on the solid foundation of game mechanics, validation, and state management, this phase will implement user-friendly interfaces that allow players to interact with the game naturally and intuitively.

The system will provide multiple interface options (CLI, web-based, API) while maintaining the scalable, robust architecture that allows easy addition of new components. The focus is on creating interfaces that make the complex TI4 mechanics accessible and enjoyable for human players while preserving the framework's capability for AI integration.

5. WHEN I review game history THEN the system SHALL provide a log of recent actions and major game events
6. WHEN I need rule clarification THEN the system SHALL provide relevant rule text and examples

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the TI4 framework, I want a clean REST API, so that I can build custom interfaces and tools on top of the game engine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query game state THEN the API SHALL return structured JSON data with complete game information
2. WHEN I submit actions THEN the API SHALL validate and execute them, returning updated game state or error details
3. WHEN I create a new game THEN the API SHALL provide endpoints for game setup and configuration
4. WHEN I need real-time updates THEN the API SHALL support WebSocket connections for live game state changes
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the API SHALL return standardized error responses with actionable information
6. WHEN I query available actions THEN the API SHALL return all legal moves with context and requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game session manager, I want robust game persistence and session management, so that games can be saved, loaded, and resumed across multiple sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I save a game THEN the system SHALL persist the complete game state including history and metadata
2. WHEN I load a game THEN the system SHALL restore the exact game state with all player information intact
3. WHEN multiple games are running THEN the system SHALL manage separate game sessions without interference
4. WHEN a game session is interrupted THEN the system SHALL automatically save progress and allow resumption
5. WHEN I query saved games THEN the system SHALL provide game metadata, player information, and save timestamps
6. WHEN I delete a saved game THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data and free resources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player learning TI4, I want interactive tutorials and guided gameplay, so that I can understand the complex rules and mechanics progressively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start a tutorial THEN the system SHALL guide me through basic game concepts with interactive examples
2. WHEN I make mistakes THEN the system SHALL provide educational feedback explaining why actions are invalid
3. WHEN I encounter new mechanics THEN the system SHALL offer contextual explanations and rule references
4. WHEN I complete tutorial sections THEN the system SHALL track my progress and unlock advanced topics
5. WHEN I need practice THEN the system SHALL provide scenario-based challenges focusing on specific mechanics
6. WHEN I'm ready for full games THEN the system SHALL offer difficulty-scaled AI opponents for learning

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a competitive player, I want advanced game analysis tools, so that I can review my gameplay and improve my strategic decision-making.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete a game THEN the system SHALL provide detailed game statistics and analysis
2. WHEN I review my moves THEN the system SHALL show alternative actions and their potential outcomes
3. WHEN I analyze board positions THEN the system SHALL highlight strategic opportunities and threats
4. WHEN I compare games THEN the system SHALL identify patterns in my play style and decision-making
5. WHEN I study specific scenarios THEN the system SHALL allow me to replay and modify game situations
6. WHEN I want to improve THEN the system SHALL suggest areas for strategic development based on my play history

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and administration tools, so that I can manage multiple game sessions and ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the admin interface SHALL display performance metrics, active games, and resource usage
2. WHEN managing game sessions THEN the admin interface SHALL allow viewing, pausing, and terminating games as needed
3. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the admin interface SHALL provide detailed logs and diagnostic information
4. WHEN scaling the system THEN the admin interface SHALL support configuration of resource limits and performance settings
5. WHEN backing up data THEN the admin interface SHALL provide tools for data export and system backup
6. WHEN maintaining the system THEN the admin interface SHALL allow updates and maintenance without disrupting active games

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a framework architect, I want modular interface components, so that new interface types and features can be added easily without disrupting existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new interface types THEN the system SHALL support them through standardized interface contracts
2. WHEN extending functionality THEN new features SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing interface components
3. WHEN customizing interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide plugin-style architecture for interface modifications
4. WHEN updating components THEN changes SHALL not break existing interface implementations
5. WHEN deploying interfaces THEN the system SHALL support independent deployment and versioning of interface components
6. WHEN testing interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive testing frameworks for interface validation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want systematic test coverage mapped to the Living Rules Reference (LRR), so that I can confidently add individual game components knowing that all rules are properly validated and enforced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing any LRR rule THEN the system SHALL have at least one test that demonstrates proper implementation and validation of that rule
2. WHEN adding new game components THEN existing rule tests SHALL continue to pass, ensuring no rule violations are introduced
3. WHEN reviewing rule coverage THEN the system SHALL provide a mapping document or index linking each LRR rule to its corresponding test(s)
4. WHEN LRR rules are updated THEN the corresponding tests SHALL be identified and updated to match the new rule text
5. WHEN developing new features THEN developers SHALL be able to reference the rule-to-test mapping to understand existing rule implementations
6. WHEN validating game correctness THEN the complete rule test suite SHALL serve as acceptance criteria for full TI4 rule compliance
7. WHEN adding factions, action cards, or other components THEN the systematic rule coverage SHALL provide confidence that the game framework will not break
