# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Rule 10: ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, a unit ability that allows certain units (primarily Destroyers) to attack enemy fighters before normal space combat begins. This ability occurs during the first round of space combat only and follows specific targeting and timing rules.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player with units that have Anti-Fighter Barrage ability, I want to roll dice to attack enemy fighters before normal space combat begins, so that I can potentially destroy fighters before they can participate in combat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a space combat begins AND I have units with Anti-Fighter Barrage ability THEN the system SHALL allow me to perform anti-fighter barrage rolls before normal combat
2. WHEN performing anti-fighter barrage rolls THEN the system SHALL use each unit's specific anti-fighter barrage value and dice count
3. WHEN rolling anti-fighter barrage dice THEN hits SHALL be produced for each die roll equal to or greater than the unit's anti-fighter barrage value
4. WHEN anti-fighter barrage occurs THEN it SHALL only happen during the first round of space combat

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player whose fighters are targeted by Anti-Fighter Barrage, I want to assign hits to my fighters and destroy them accordingly, so that the combat mechanics work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN anti-fighter barrage hits are produced THEN I SHALL choose which of my fighters in the active system to destroy
2. WHEN assigning anti-fighter barrage hits THEN each hit SHALL destroy exactly one fighter
3. WHEN there are more hits than available fighters THEN excess hits SHALL have no effect
4. WHEN fighters are destroyed by anti-fighter barrage THEN they SHALL be removed from the combat before normal combat begins

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want Anti-Fighter Barrage to work according to the specific timing and targeting rules, so that the ability functions correctly within the game's combat system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Anti-Fighter Barrage THEN it SHALL only target enemy fighters in the active system
2. WHEN Anti-Fighter Barrage occurs THEN it SHALL happen before any other combat steps
3. WHEN using Anti-Fighter Barrage THEN combat roll effects like rerolls and modifiers SHALL NOT affect the barrage rolls
4. WHEN a unit has Anti-Fighter Barrage ability THEN it SHALL be usable even if no enemy fighters are present

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Anti-Fighter Barrage system to integrate properly with existing combat and unit systems, so that it works seamlessly with the rest of the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN units have Anti-Fighter Barrage ability THEN the system SHALL properly detect and display the ability with correct values
2. WHEN parsing unit abilities THEN the system SHALL handle the "Anti-Fighter Barrage X (xY)" format correctly
3. WHEN integrating with space combat THEN Anti-Fighter Barrage SHALL be properly sequenced in the combat flow
4. WHEN managing game state THEN Anti-Fighter Barrage results SHALL be properly tracked and applied

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want comprehensive error handling and validation for Anti-Fighter Barrage, so that edge cases are handled gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no fighters are present THEN Anti-Fighter Barrage SHALL still be usable but have no effect
2. WHEN invalid targets are selected THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN combat state is invalid THEN Anti-Fighter Barrage SHALL fail gracefully with appropriate feedback
4. WHEN system errors occur during Anti-Fighter Barrage THEN the game state SHALL remain consistent
