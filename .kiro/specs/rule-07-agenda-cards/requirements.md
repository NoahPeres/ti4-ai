# Requirements Document: Rule 7 - AGENDA CARDS

## Introduction

This specification covers the implementation of Rule 7: AGENDA CARDS from the TI4 Living Rules Reference. Agenda cards are political cards that create laws and directives during the agenda phase, forming a core component of the political gameplay in Twilight Imperium. This implementation will provide the foundation for political decision-making, voting mechanics, and law effects that persist throughout the game.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Agenda Card System Foundation

**User Story:** As a game system, I want to manage agenda cards so that political gameplay can function according to TI4 rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create an agenda deck with all standard agenda cards
2. WHEN an agenda card is drawn THEN the system SHALL track its type (law or directive)
3. WHEN an agenda card has outcomes THEN the system SHALL store all possible voting outcomes
4. IF an agenda card is a law THEN the system SHALL track its persistent effects
5. WHEN agenda cards are discarded THEN the system SHALL manage the discard pile appropriately

### Requirement 2: Agenda Card Types and Properties

**User Story:** As a player, I want agenda cards to have distinct types and properties so that I can understand their effects and vote appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agenda card is created THEN it SHALL have a defined type (law or directive)
2. WHEN an agenda card is a law THEN it SHALL have persistent effects that remain in play
3. WHEN an agenda card is a directive THEN it SHALL have immediate effects that resolve once
4. WHEN an agenda card has voting outcomes THEN it SHALL define all possible results
5. IF an agenda card has "for" and "against" outcomes THEN the system SHALL track both options

### Requirement 3: Agenda Card Effects System

**User Story:** As a game system, I want to apply agenda card effects so that laws and directives modify gameplay according to their specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a law is passed THEN the system SHALL apply its persistent effects to the game state
2. WHEN a directive is resolved THEN the system SHALL execute its immediate effects
3. WHEN a law is in effect THEN the system SHALL enforce its rules during relevant game actions
4. IF a law conflicts with base rules THEN the law SHALL take precedence
5. WHEN multiple laws are in effect THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts according to timing rules

### Requirement 4: Agenda Card Integration with Voting

**User Story:** As a player, I want to vote on agenda cards so that I can influence political outcomes in the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agenda card is revealed THEN the system SHALL present voting options to all players
2. WHEN players vote THEN the system SHALL track votes for each outcome
3. WHEN voting concludes THEN the system SHALL determine the winning outcome
4. IF there is a tie THEN the system SHALL apply speaker tie-breaking rules
5. WHEN an outcome wins THEN the system SHALL apply the corresponding effects

### Requirement 5: Agenda Card Deck Management

**User Story:** As a game system, I want to manage the agenda deck so that cards are drawn and discarded properly throughout the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL shuffle the agenda deck
2. WHEN an agenda card is needed THEN the system SHALL draw from the top of the deck
3. WHEN the agenda deck is empty THEN the system SHALL reshuffle the discard pile
4. WHEN agenda cards are discarded THEN they SHALL go to the discard pile
5. IF specific cards are removed from the game THEN they SHALL not return to the deck

### Requirement 6: Law Persistence and Tracking

**User Story:** As a game system, I want to track active laws so that their effects are consistently applied throughout the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a law is passed THEN it SHALL remain in effect for the rest of the game
2. WHEN checking game rules THEN the system SHALL consider all active laws
3. WHEN a law modifies a game mechanic THEN the system SHALL apply the modification consistently
4. IF a law is replaced by another law THEN the old law SHALL be removed from play
5. WHEN the game state is saved THEN active laws SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 7: Complete Agenda Card Implementation

**User Story:** As a player, I want all actual agenda cards from the game to be implemented so that I can experience the full political gameplay of TI4.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing agenda cards THEN all cards from the ability compendium CSV SHALL be included
2. WHEN an agenda card is drawn THEN it SHALL have its actual game text and effects
3. WHEN agenda cards have specific outcomes THEN they SHALL match the official card outcomes
4. IF agenda cards reference specific game components THEN the references SHALL be accurately implemented
5. WHEN agenda cards have complex effects THEN they SHALL be properly integrated with existing game systems

### Requirement 8: Agenda Card Data Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the ability compendium data so that agenda card implementation is accurate and complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading agenda card data THEN the system SHALL parse the ability compendium CSV
2. WHEN creating agenda cards THEN the system SHALL use the official card names and text
3. WHEN defining card effects THEN the system SHALL implement the actual game mechanics
4. IF card data is missing or incomplete THEN the system SHALL request manual confirmation
5. WHEN validating card implementations THEN they SHALL match the official card specifications

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a game system, I want robust error handling for agenda cards so that invalid states and operations are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid agenda operations are attempted THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
2. WHEN agenda card effects cannot be applied THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
3. WHEN voting on invalid outcomes THEN the system SHALL reject the vote
4. IF agenda card data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect and report the issue
5. WHEN recovering from errors THEN the system SHALL maintain game state consistency
