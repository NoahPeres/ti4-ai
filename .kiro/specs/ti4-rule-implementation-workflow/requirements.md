# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec defines a systematic workflow for implementing TI4 game rules with strict TDD methodology, comprehensive documentation, and evidence-based progress tracking. The goal is to achieve slow, steady, stable iteration from our current 7.2% implementation to a fully functional core game system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Rule Implementation Verification System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the current implementation status of rules before starting new work, so that I don't duplicate effort and can accurately track progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking a rule's implementation status THEN the system SHALL verify actual test coverage and passing status
2. WHEN a rule is marked as complete THEN the system SHALL validate that all sub-rules have corresponding test cases
3. IF a rule's documentation status conflicts with actual implementation THEN the system SHALL update tracking documents to reflect reality
4. WHEN updating rule status THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive mapping of rules to test cases in both `.trae/lrr_analysis/` and `docs/` directories

### Requirement 2: Next Rule Prioritization System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify the next highest-priority rule to implement, so that I can maintain optimal dependency order and maximize system functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting the next rule THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on dependency analysis and implementation complexity
2. WHEN a rule has unmet dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify and recommend implementing dependencies first
3. WHEN multiple rules are available THEN the system SHALL recommend the rule that enables the most downstream functionality
4. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL include estimated effort and expected impact

### Requirement 3: Strict TDD Implementation Process

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to follow strict TDD methodology for rule implementation, so that I ensure robust, testable, and maintainable code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a new rule implementation THEN the system SHALL read the complete LRR text for that rule before creating any tests
2. WHEN creating tests THEN the system SHALL ensure RED phase failures are assertion-based, not import/syntax errors
3. WHEN implementing functionality THEN the system SHALL write minimal code to pass tests (GREEN phase)
4. WHEN completing each test cycle THEN the system SHALL explicitly consider and document refactoring decisions (REFACTOR phase)
5. WHEN adding functionality THEN the system SHALL NOT implement features not covered by tests
6. WHEN encountering rule conflicts or ambiguities THEN the system SHALL prompt the user for clarification with recommended options

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Documentation Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain accurate rule-to-test mappings and implementation status, so that the project remains organized and progress is trackable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing a rule THEN the system SHALL update both `.trae/lrr_analysis/{rule_number}_{rule_name}.md` and corresponding `docs/` files
2. WHEN adding test cases THEN the system SHALL document which specific sub-rules each test demonstrates
3. WHEN completing a rule THEN the system SHALL update the IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md with accurate progress metrics
4. WHEN updating documentation THEN the system SHALL follow the established format from existing rule documentation
5. WHEN documenting test cases THEN the system SHALL include test file names, test method names, and rule sub-sections covered

### Requirement 5: Quality Assurance Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated quality checks integrated into the implementation workflow, so that code quality remains high throughout development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use `uv run pytest` with verbose output
2. WHEN checking code quality THEN the system SHALL use `make check-all` for comprehensive validation
3. WHEN implementing new code THEN the system SHALL ensure type checking passes with `uv run mypy src`
4. WHEN completing implementation THEN the system SHALL verify linting passes with `uv run ruff check src tests`
5. WHEN all quality checks pass THEN the system SHALL update progress metrics and documentation

### Requirement 6: LRR Compliance Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all implementations strictly adhere to the Living Rules Reference, so that the game system remains accurate and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing rule functionality THEN the system SHALL NOT add features not explicitly described in the LRR
2. WHEN encountering implementation conflicts THEN the system SHALL prioritize LRR accuracy over convenience
3. WHEN creating tests THEN the system SHALL verify each test corresponds to actual LRR rule text
4. WHEN completing a rule THEN the system SHALL validate that all LRR sub-rules are covered by tests
5. IF implementation contradicts LRR THEN the system SHALL halt and request user guidance

### Requirement 7: Progress Tracking and Metrics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want accurate progress tracking and metrics, so that I can understand project status and plan future work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing a rule THEN the system SHALL update overall progress percentage in IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
2. WHEN updating progress THEN the system SHALL maintain accurate counts of completed vs total rules
3. WHEN tracking metrics THEN the system SHALL categorize rules by layer (Foundation, Core Game, Advanced Mechanics)
4. WHEN providing status updates THEN the system SHALL include test count, coverage percentage, and quality metrics
5. WHEN planning next steps THEN the system SHALL recommend rules that maximize progress toward functional gameplay
