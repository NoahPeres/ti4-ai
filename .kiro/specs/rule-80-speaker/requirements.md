# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Rule 80: SPEAKER in the TI4 AI system. The speaker is a fundamental role in Twilight Imperium 4 that determines initiative order, tie-breaking authority, and agenda phase responsibilities. This implementation will provide a complete speaker system that integrates with existing game mechanics including initiative order, agenda phase, and the Politics strategy card.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game system, I want to track which player is the current speaker, so that initiative order and tie-breaking can be properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game is initialized THEN the system SHALL designate one player as the initial speaker
2. WHEN the speaker token is passed THEN the system SHALL update the current speaker to the new player
3. WHEN queried for the current speaker THEN the system SHALL return the correct player identifier
4. WHEN the speaker changes THEN the system SHALL notify relevant game components of the change

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the speaker to determine initiative order, so that turn order follows the official TI4 rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining initiative order THEN the speaker SHALL be first in the order
2. WHEN multiple players have the same initiative value THEN the speaker SHALL break ties by choosing the order
3. WHEN the speaker changes THEN the initiative order SHALL be recalculated accordingly
4. WHEN generating turn order THEN the system SHALL place the speaker first regardless of strategy card numbers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the speaker to break ties in voting and other game situations, so that deadlocks can be resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a vote results in a tie THEN the speaker SHALL choose which outcome to resolve
2. WHEN multiple outcomes have equal votes THEN the speaker SHALL have the authority to decide
3. WHEN the speaker breaks a tie THEN the system SHALL record that the tie was resolved by speaker decision
4. WHEN no votes are cast for an agenda THEN the speaker SHALL choose the outcome

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the speaker token to be passed during the agenda phase, so that speaker privileges rotate among players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agenda phase ends THEN the speaker SHALL choose which player receives the speaker token
2. WHEN the speaker token is passed THEN the new speaker SHALL become active for the next round
3. WHEN passing the speaker token THEN the speaker SHALL be able to choose any player including themselves
4. WHEN the speaker token is passed THEN the system SHALL validate the chosen player is valid

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player with the Politics strategy card, I want the option to claim the speaker token, so that I can gain speaker privileges instead of drawing action cards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player has the Politics strategy card THEN they SHALL have the option to claim the speaker token
2. WHEN claiming the speaker token via Politics THEN the player SHALL become the new speaker immediately
3. WHEN claiming the speaker token via Politics THEN the player SHALL not draw action cards as the alternative benefit
4. WHEN the Politics strategy card is played THEN the system SHALL offer the speaker token option to the player

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game system, I want to integrate speaker functionality with the agenda phase, so that agenda resolution follows proper speaker protocols.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN revealing agenda cards THEN the speaker SHALL be the one to reveal them
2. WHEN conducting votes THEN the speaker SHALL vote last in the voting order
3. WHEN resolving agenda outcomes THEN the speaker SHALL have final authority on tied results
4. WHEN the agenda phase begins THEN the system SHALL ensure the speaker has proper agenda phase privileges

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a game system, I want to validate speaker actions and state changes, so that the speaker system maintains consistency and prevents invalid operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attempting to set a speaker THEN the system SHALL validate the player exists and is active
2. WHEN the speaker token is passed THEN the system SHALL ensure the target player is valid
3. WHEN speaker privileges are used THEN the system SHALL verify the current speaker has the authority
4. WHEN speaker state changes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all game components

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a game system, I want to provide speaker status information, so that other game components can query speaker-related information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queried for speaker status THEN the system SHALL return the current speaker's identity
2. WHEN checking if a player is the speaker THEN the system SHALL return accurate boolean status
3. WHEN generating game state information THEN the system SHALL include current speaker information
4. WHEN other systems need speaker information THEN the system SHALL provide reliable speaker data
