# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the critical issues identified in PR 35 code review. The review identified 12 actionable comments that need to be fixed to improve code quality, maintainability, and correctness. These fixes focus on preventing duplicate transaction IDs, ensuring atomic transaction operations, maintaining immutability, proper error handling, and improving test robustness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Transaction ID Uniqueness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to prevent duplicate pending transaction IDs, so that the system maintains data integrity and prevents silent overwrites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction is added to pending transactions AND the transaction ID already exists THEN the system SHALL raise a ValueError with a descriptive message
2. WHEN a transaction is added to pending transactions AND the transaction ID is unique THEN the system SHALL proceed normally
3. WHEN the error is raised THEN the error message SHALL include the offending transaction ID for debugging

### Requirement 2: Atomic Transaction Operations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want transaction application to be atomic, so that the system never has inconsistent state where history is updated but effects fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying transaction effects THEN the system SHALL apply resource effects first before committing to history
2. WHEN applying transaction effects THEN the system SHALL apply promissory note effects before committing to history
3. WHEN applying transaction effects THEN the system SHALL validate the resulting state before committing to history
4. WHEN effects succeed AND validation passes THEN the system SHALL commit the transaction to history
5. WHEN effects fail OR validation fails THEN the system SHALL NOT commit to history

### Requirement 3: Immutable State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure previous game states remain immutable, so that the system maintains proper functional programming principles and prevents accidental mutations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying resource effects THEN the system SHALL create deep copies of Player objects before mutation
2. WHEN applying promissory note effects THEN the system SHALL properly clone the PromissoryNoteManager state
3. WHEN cloning PromissoryNoteManager THEN the system SHALL preserve both player hands and available notes
4. WHEN creating new state THEN the system SHALL NOT mutate objects from previous states

### Requirement 4: Zero Amount Transfer Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want zero-amount transfers to be handled as no-ops consistently, so that the system behavior matches Player method expectations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transferring zero trade goods THEN the system SHALL return early without validation or modification
2. WHEN transferring zero commodities THEN the system SHALL return early without validation or modification
3. WHEN validating transfer amounts THEN the system SHALL reject negative amounts but allow zero amounts
4. WHEN zero amounts are processed THEN the system SHALL mirror Player.spend_trade_goods behavior

### Requirement 5: GameState Synchronization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the transaction manager to keep GameState pending transactions synchronized, so that there is a single source of truth for transaction state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN proposing a transaction THEN the system SHALL update both manager cache and GameState pending transactions
2. WHEN accepting a transaction THEN the system SHALL use GameState.apply_transaction_effects for execution
3. WHEN rejecting a transaction THEN the system SHALL remove it from both manager cache and GameState pending transactions
4. WHEN cancelling a transaction THEN the system SHALL remove it from both manager cache and GameState pending transactions

### Requirement 6: Robust Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want specific exception types in tests and proper rollback handling, so that error conditions are properly validated and system state remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing validation errors THEN tests SHALL assert specific exception types (TransactionValidationError) not generic Exception
2. WHEN transaction rollback occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve asset type distinctions (commodities vs trade goods)
3. WHEN observer notifications fail THEN the system SHALL continue notifying other observers
4. WHEN rollback fails THEN the system SHALL raise TransactionRollbackError with context

### Requirement 7: Test Quality Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to be robust and maintainable, so that they provide reliable validation without coupling to implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing GameState operations THEN tests SHALL assert behavior not private attributes
2. WHEN testing immutability THEN tests SHALL verify new objects are created (identity checks)
3. WHEN testing transaction results THEN tests SHALL assert explicit success/failure states
4. WHEN testing error conditions THEN tests SHALL verify specific error messages and types

### Requirement 8: Code Quality Enhancements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code with proper typing and documentation, so that the codebase is easy to understand and modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining method signatures THEN unused parameters SHALL be removed
2. WHEN handling collections THEN proper typing SHALL be used instead of Any
3. WHEN documenting methods THEN ValueError conditions SHALL be documented in docstrings
4. WHEN implementing duplicate logic THEN it SHALL be consolidated to avoid divergence

### Requirement 9: Observer Pattern Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want observer notifications to be resilient to individual observer failures, so that one failing observer doesn't break the entire notification system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notifying transaction observers THEN each observer SHALL be called in a try-catch block
2. WHEN an observer fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other observers
3. WHEN all observers are notified THEN the system SHALL complete successfully regardless of individual failures
4. WHEN logging observer errors THEN the system SHALL use the project logger when available

### Requirement 10: Validation Method Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want validation methods to have consistent behavior and proper error reporting, so that validation logic is predictable and debuggable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation fails THEN specific validation errors SHALL be raised with descriptive messages
2. WHEN checking neighbor requirements THEN player IDs and system information SHALL be included in error messages
3. WHEN checking resource availability THEN current and required amounts SHALL be included in error messages
4. WHEN validation succeeds THEN methods SHALL return appropriate success indicators

### Requirement 11: Transaction History Integrity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want transaction history to be managed consistently, so that there is no divergence between different history tracking mechanisms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing transaction history THEN the system SHALL use GameState as the single source of truth
2. WHEN accessing transaction history THEN the system SHALL delegate to GameState methods
3. WHEN adding history entries THEN duplicate storage mechanisms SHALL be avoided
4. WHEN querying history THEN results SHALL come from the authoritative GameState source

### Requirement 12: API State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the transaction API to provide access to updated GameState, so that callers can access the current state after operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transaction operations modify GameState THEN the API SHALL provide access to updated state
2. WHEN returning transaction results THEN the API SHALL include GameState reference or accessor method
3. WHEN integrating with stateful systems THEN the API SHALL support retrieving current GameState
4. WHEN API operations complete THEN callers SHALL have access to the resulting system state
