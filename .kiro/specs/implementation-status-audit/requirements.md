# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This manual audit will systematically review every LRR rule (1-101) to determine the current implementation status in the TI4 AI project. The audit will examine LRR analysis documents, test files, and production code to create a comprehensive status document with exactly 101 paragraphs - one for each rule in numerical order.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Systematic Rule-by-Rule Analysis

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want a comprehensive manual review of all 101 LRR rules in numerical order, so that I can understand the exact implementation status of each rule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting the audit THEN the reviewer SHALL examine each rule from 1 to 101 in sequential order
2. WHEN analyzing each rule THEN the reviewer SHALL check LRR analysis documents, test files, and production code
3. WHEN documenting status THEN the reviewer SHALL write exactly one paragraph per rule summarizing implementation status
4. WHEN identifying discrepancies THEN the reviewer SHALL note when implementations exist but aren't reflected in LRR analysis
5. IF a rule has multiple sub-rules THEN the reviewer SHALL address all sub-components within that rule's paragraph

### Requirement 2: Implementation Status Verification

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want to verify the actual implementation status by examining code and tests, so that I can identify gaps between documentation and reality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing each rule THEN the reviewer SHALL examine corresponding source code files in src/ti4/
2. WHEN checking test coverage THEN the reviewer SHALL identify all test files related to each rule
3. WHEN evaluating completeness THEN the reviewer SHALL categorize each rule as "Fully Implemented", "Partially Implemented", "Spec Only", or "Not Started"
4. WHEN finding undocumented implementations THEN the reviewer SHALL note these for LRR analysis updates
5. IF tests exist without implementation or vice versa THEN the reviewer SHALL flag these inconsistencies

### Requirement 3: Executive Summary Documentation

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want concise executive summaries for each rule, so that I can quickly understand project status without diving into technical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing rule summaries THEN the reviewer SHALL create exactly 101 paragraphs in a single document
2. WHEN documenting each rule THEN the reviewer SHALL include rule number, title, and implementation status
3. WHEN describing status THEN the reviewer SHALL focus on what exists, what's missing, and priority level
4. WHEN providing summaries THEN the reviewer SHALL avoid technical implementation details
5. IF a rule is complex THEN the reviewer SHALL still constrain the summary to one paragraph

### Requirement 4: LRR Analysis Reconciliation

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want to identify where LRR analysis documents need updates, so that documentation stays synchronized with actual implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing LRR analysis files THEN the reviewer SHALL compare them against actual code implementation
2. WHEN finding missing analysis THEN the reviewer SHALL note rules that need new LRR analysis documents
3. WHEN discovering outdated analysis THEN the reviewer SHALL identify specific updates needed
4. WHEN evaluating accuracy THEN the reviewer SHALL verify that analysis reflects current implementation state
5. IF analysis contradicts implementation THEN the reviewer SHALL document the discrepancy for resolution

### Requirement 5: Test Coverage Mapping

**User Story:** As a quality engineer, I want to understand test coverage for each rule, so that I can identify testing gaps and prioritize test development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining tests THEN the reviewer SHALL identify all test files covering each rule
2. WHEN evaluating coverage THEN the reviewer SHALL note whether tests cover core functionality, edge cases, and error conditions
3. WHEN finding test gaps THEN the reviewer SHALL document missing test scenarios
4. WHEN reviewing test quality THEN the reviewer SHALL assess whether tests adequately validate rule implementation
5. IF tests are incomplete THEN the reviewer SHALL note specific areas needing additional test coverage

### Requirement 6: Priority and Roadmap Assessment

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to understand implementation priorities and next steps, so that I can plan future development cycles effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing each rule THEN the reviewer SHALL evaluate its importance to core game functionality
2. WHEN identifying gaps THEN the reviewer SHALL suggest priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN the reviewer SHALL note rules that block other implementations
4. WHEN planning next steps THEN the reviewer SHALL identify logical implementation sequences
5. IF rules are interdependent THEN the reviewer SHALL document these relationships for planning purposes

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Status Document

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want a single authoritative document showing the status of all 101 rules, so that I can understand project completeness at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the final document THEN the reviewer SHALL produce exactly 101 numbered paragraphs
2. WHEN organizing content THEN the reviewer SHALL follow LRR rule numerical order (1-101)
3. WHEN formatting output THEN the reviewer SHALL use consistent structure for each rule summary
4. WHEN providing overview THEN the reviewer SHALL include summary statistics and completion percentages
5. IF the document exceeds reasonable length THEN the reviewer SHALL maintain conciseness while ensuring completeness

### Requirement 8: No Code Implementation

**User Story:** As a documentation reviewer, I want this audit to focus purely on analysis and documentation, so that it doesn't introduce new code changes that could affect the assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting the audit THEN the reviewer SHALL NOT write, modify, or generate any production code
2. WHEN examining implementations THEN the reviewer SHALL only read and analyze existing code
3. WHEN identifying issues THEN the reviewer SHALL document them for future implementation rather than fixing them
4. WHEN updating documentation THEN the reviewer SHALL focus on analysis documents rather than code comments
5. IF code changes are needed THEN the reviewer SHALL note them as recommendations for separate implementation tasks
