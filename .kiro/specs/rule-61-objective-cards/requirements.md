# Requirements Document - Rule 61: OBJECTIVE CARDS Completion

## Introduction

This specification completes the implementation of Rule 61: OBJECTIVE CARDS by addressing the remaining gaps in the mostly-complete objective system. The current implementation has ~85% coverage with comprehensive test coverage for core mechanics, but is missing critical components for a fully functional objective system including Stage I/II public objective progression, home system control validation, and concrete objective card implementations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Public Objective Setup and Progression System

**User Story:** As a game system, I want to properly manage the Stage I and Stage II public objective progression so that objectives are revealed in the correct order according to LRR rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is set up THEN the system SHALL place 5 Stage I and 5 Stage II public objective cards face-down near the victory point track
2. WHEN the speaker reveals a public objective during status phase THEN the system SHALL reveal the next Stage I objective if Stage I objectives remain
3. WHEN all Stage I objectives are revealed AND the speaker must reveal another objective THEN the system SHALL reveal the next Stage II objective
4. WHEN all public objectives are revealed AND the speaker must reveal another objective THEN the game SHALL end immediately
5. WHEN the game ends due to all objectives being revealed THEN the system SHALL determine the winner based on victory points and initiative order

### Requirement 2: Home System Control Validation

**User Story:** As a player, I want the system to prevent me from scoring public objectives when I don't control my home system so that the game enforces LRR Rule 61.16 correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player attempts to score a public objective THEN the system SHALL verify the player controls all planets in their home system
2. WHEN a player does not control all planets in their home system THEN the system SHALL prevent public objective scoring with a clear error message
3. WHEN a player controls all planets in their home system THEN the system SHALL allow public objective scoring to proceed
4. WHEN validating home system control THEN the system SHALL check each planet in the player's home system for control
5. WHEN a player's home system has multiple planets THEN the system SHALL require control of ALL planets for public objective eligibility

### Requirement 3: Complete Concrete Objective Card Implementation

**User Story:** As a game system, I want to implement all TI4 objective cards with working requirement validation so that players can experience the complete objective system with all official cards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Stage I public objectives THEN the system SHALL include all 20 Stage I objectives (10 base game + 10 Prophecy of Kings) with complete requirement validation
2. WHEN implementing Stage II public objectives THEN the system SHALL include all 20 Stage II objectives (10 base game + 10 Prophecy of Kings) with complete requirement validation
3. WHEN implementing secret objectives THEN the system SHALL include all 40 secret objectives (18 base game + 19 Prophecy of Kings + 3 Codex III) with complete requirement validation
4. WHEN a player meets an objective's requirements THEN the system SHALL correctly validate and allow scoring with proper phase restrictions
5. WHEN a player does not meet an objective's requirements THEN the system SHALL prevent scoring with specific feedback about missing requirements
6. WHEN implementing objectives THEN the system SHALL support all requirement types: resource spending, planet control, technology ownership, unit presence, combat victories, and special conditions

### Requirement 4: Objective Requirement System Integration

**User Story:** As a player, I want objective requirements to properly integrate with game systems so that objectives can detect when I've met their conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an objective requires controlling planets THEN the system SHALL integrate with the planet control system to validate requirements
2. WHEN an objective requires spending resources or influence THEN the system SHALL integrate with the resource management system
3. WHEN an objective requires destroying units THEN the system SHALL integrate with the combat and destruction systems
4. WHEN an objective requires having technologies THEN the system SHALL integrate with the technology system
5. WHEN an objective has multiple requirements THEN the system SHALL validate ALL requirements are met before allowing scoring

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Objective Completion Detection

**User Story:** As a game system, I want to automatically detect when players become eligible to score objectives so that the game can provide helpful notifications and maintain accurate state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player's game state changes THEN the system SHALL check if any objectives become newly scoreable
2. WHEN a player becomes eligible for an objective THEN the system SHALL track this eligibility for query purposes
3. WHEN checking objective eligibility THEN the system SHALL respect phase-based scoring restrictions
4. WHEN checking objective eligibility THEN the system SHALL respect one-time scoring limitations
5. WHEN multiple players become eligible for the same public objective THEN the system SHALL track eligibility for each player independently

### Requirement 6: Victory Point Scoreboard Integration

**User Story:** As a player, I want the objective system to properly integrate with the victory point tracking system so that scoring objectives correctly advances my position toward victory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player scores an objective THEN the system SHALL immediately update the victory point track with the correct point value
2. WHEN updating victory points THEN the system SHALL place the player's control token on the scored objective card
3. WHEN checking for game end conditions THEN the system SHALL detect when a player reaches the victory point threshold
4. WHEN multiple players have the same victory points THEN the system SHALL use initiative order for tie-breaking
5. WHEN displaying game state THEN the system SHALL show current victory point standings and scored objectives for each player

### Requirement 7: Objective System Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a game system, I want the objective system to perform efficiently and reliably so that it doesn't impact game performance or introduce bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating objective requirements THEN the system SHALL complete validation within 50ms for typical game states
2. WHEN managing objective state THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all game operations
3. WHEN handling objective scoring THEN the system SHALL provide atomic operations that cannot leave the game in an inconsistent state
4. WHEN processing objective eligibility THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN integrating with existing systems THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with all existing functionality
