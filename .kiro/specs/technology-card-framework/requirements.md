# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a comprehensive technology card implementation framework for TI4, with Dark Energy Tap as the first concrete implementation. The framework will provide a clear, extensible system for implementing all technology cards with proper interfaces to abilities, unit stats, exhaustion mechanics, and game components. This system will enable future developers to easily add new technology cards following established patterns and protocols.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear file structure for technology card implementations, so that I can easily find, understand, and add new technology cards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the codebase THEN I SHALL find a dedicated directory structure for concrete technology implementations
2. WHEN I look at the technology directory THEN I SHALL see clear separation between abstract interfaces and concrete implementations
3. WHEN I need to add a new technology THEN I SHALL have a clear template and location to follow
4. WHEN I examine existing implementations THEN I SHALL see consistent file naming and organization patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear interfaces between technology cards and other game components, so that I can understand how technologies interact with abilities, unit stats, and game mechanics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a technology has abilities THEN the system SHALL provide clear integration with the abilities system
2. WHEN a technology affects unit stats THEN the system SHALL integrate with the unit stats system
3. WHEN a technology requires exhaustion mechanics THEN the system SHALL integrate with the exhausted card system
4. WHEN a technology has timing windows THEN the system SHALL provide clear hooks for player actions
5. WHEN a technology has costs THEN the system SHALL integrate with the cost management system

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive protocol for implementing technology cards, so that I can implement any technology card consistently and correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to implement a technology THEN I SHALL have a clear protocol that covers all possible technology attributes
2. WHEN a technology has color requirements THEN the protocol SHALL handle color specification
3. WHEN a technology has prerequisites THEN the protocol SHALL handle prerequisite validation
4. WHEN a technology is faction-specific THEN the protocol SHALL handle faction restrictions
5. WHEN a technology affects units THEN the protocol SHALL handle unit upgrade mechanics
6. WHEN a technology has abilities THEN the protocol SHALL handle ability integration
7. WHEN a technology requires manual confirmation THEN the protocol SHALL enforce the confirmation requirement

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing technology implementations refactored to align with the new framework, so that all technology implementations follow the same patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine Gravity Drive implementation THEN it SHALL follow the new framework structure
2. WHEN I examine any existing technology THEN it SHALL use the new interface patterns
3. WHEN I examine the codebase THEN all technology implementations SHALL be consistent
4. WHEN I run tests THEN all existing technology functionality SHALL continue to work

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Dark Energy Tap implemented as the first concrete example, so that I have a reference implementation for future technology cards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine Dark Energy Tap implementation THEN it SHALL demonstrate all framework capabilities
2. WHEN Dark Energy Tap is used in Rule 35 exploration THEN it SHALL properly enable frontier token exploration
3. WHEN Dark Energy Tap abilities are triggered THEN they SHALL integrate with the abilities system
4. WHEN Dark Energy Tap is exhausted THEN it SHALL follow proper exhaustion mechanics
5. WHEN Dark Energy Tap prerequisites are checked THEN they SHALL be validated correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive technology attributes supported, so that I can implement any technology card from the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a technology has a color THEN the system SHALL support color specification and validation
2. WHEN a technology has prerequisites THEN the system SHALL support prerequisite checking
3. WHEN a technology has a name THEN the system SHALL support proper naming and identification
4. WHEN a technology is faction-specific THEN the system SHALL support faction restrictions
5. WHEN a technology has abilities THEN the system SHALL support ability integration with timing windows
6. WHEN a technology has costs THEN the system SHALL support cost specification and validation
7. WHEN a technology supports exhaustion THEN the system SHALL support exhaust/ready mechanics
8. WHEN a technology affects unit stats THEN the system SHALL support unit stat modifications

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to analyze the TI4 ability compendium, so that the system supports all possible technology variations found in the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the framework is designed THEN it SHALL account for all technology types found in the ability compendium
2. WHEN the framework is designed THEN it SHALL support all ability patterns found in technology cards
3. WHEN the framework is designed THEN it SHALL support all timing patterns found in technology cards
4. WHEN the framework is designed THEN it SHALL support all cost patterns found in technology cards
5. WHEN the framework is designed THEN it SHALL support all prerequisite patterns found in technology cards

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples, so that I can easily implement new technology cards without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to implement a technology THEN I SHALL have clear documentation explaining the process
2. WHEN I need to understand the framework THEN I SHALL have comprehensive interface documentation
3. WHEN I need examples THEN I SHALL have Dark Energy Tap as a complete reference implementation
4. WHEN I need to understand integration points THEN I SHALL have clear documentation of all system interfaces
5. WHEN I make mistakes THEN I SHALL have clear error messages guiding me to the correct implementation
