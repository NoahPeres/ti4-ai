# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a comprehensive framework for Twilight Imperium 4th Edition that tracks legal game states, validates moves, and provides interfaces for both human and AI players. The framework will serve as a foundation for AI training and strategic exploration in one of the most complex board games ever created.

The system will start with core game mechanics and incrementally build toward full TI4 implementation, following test-driven development principles to ensure reliability and correctness of game state management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game framework user, I want the system to accurately track and validate the current game state, so that all players (human or AI) can rely on consistent and legal game progression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a valid starting game state with proper galaxy setup, faction assignments, and initial resources
2. WHEN any game action is attempted THEN the system SHALL validate the action against current game rules and state before applying changes
3. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL update all relevant game components (player resources, board positions, technology trees, etc.) atomically
4. IF an invalid move is attempted THEN the system SHALL reject the move and provide clear feedback about why it was invalid
5. WHEN queried THEN the system SHALL provide complete and accurate information about the current game state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player (human or AI), I want to query available legal moves at any point in the game, so that I can make informed strategic decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it is a player's turn THEN the system SHALL provide a complete list of all legal actions available to that player
2. WHEN a player queries possible moves THEN the system SHALL include context about prerequisites, costs, and potential outcomes for each action
3. WHEN game phase changes THEN the system SHALL update available actions to reflect the current phase rules
4. IF no legal moves are available THEN the system SHALL indicate this and suggest appropriate next steps (pass, end turn, etc.)
5. WHEN multiple players can act simultaneously THEN the system SHALL correctly identify and present concurrent action opportunities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want a clean programmatic interface to interact with the game, so that I can be trained to play TI4 effectively without human intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI agent queries the game state THEN the system SHALL provide structured data in a consistent format
2. WHEN an AI agent attempts an action THEN the system SHALL accept the action through a standardized API
3. WHEN multiple AI agents are playing THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests and maintain turn order
4. IF an AI agent makes an invalid move THEN the system SHALL provide structured error information that can be processed programmatically
5. WHEN an AI agent needs to make choices (combat rolls, agenda votes, etc.) THEN the system SHALL provide clear decision points with all necessary context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a human player, I want an intuitive interface to view game state and make moves, so that I can play against AI agents or other humans effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a human player views the game THEN the system SHALL present the game state in a clear, understandable format
2. WHEN a human player wants to make a move THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly input methods
3. WHEN it's a human player's turn THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate available actions and their consequences
4. IF a human player makes an invalid move THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages in natural language
5. WHEN a human player needs game information THEN the system SHALL provide detailed explanations and rule references

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to be modular and extensible, so that I can incrementally add TI4 mechanics and easily maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new game mechanics are added THEN the system SHALL integrate them without breaking existing functionality
2. WHEN the codebase is modified THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive test coverage for all game rules
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and state inspection capabilities
4. IF game rules need modification THEN the system SHALL allow rule changes without requiring complete rewrites
5. WHEN extending the system THEN the architecture SHALL support plugin-style additions for new factions, technologies, or mechanics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a TI4 enthusiast, I want the framework to accurately implement core TI4 mechanics, so that games played through the system feel authentic and strategically meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN players take actions THEN the system SHALL enforce all relevant TI4 rules including timing, prerequisites, and interactions
2. WHEN combat occurs THEN the system SHALL implement accurate combat resolution with all modifiers and special abilities
3. WHEN the political phase occurs THEN the system SHALL handle agenda voting, speaker selection, and political effects correctly
4. IF faction-specific abilities are used THEN the system SHALL apply the correct faction powers and restrictions
5. WHEN victory conditions are checked THEN the system SHALL accurately determine if any player has achieved victory through any valid path

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the framework to be performant and reliable, so that it can handle multiple concurrent games and long-running AI training sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple games run simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain performance without degradation
2. WHEN games run for extended periods THEN the system SHALL remain stable and maintain accurate state
3. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle resource constraints
4. IF system errors occur THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully and preserve game state integrity
5. WHEN games are saved and loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain complete state fidelity across sessions
