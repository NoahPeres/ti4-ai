# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Rule 28: DEALS in the TI4 AI system, focusing specifically on component-based transactions that can be objectively validated and enforced by the game system.

The system will handle deals involving physical game components (trade goods, promissory notes, commodities) that follow clear transaction rules, while non-component agreements (promises, future actions, strategic commitments) will be managed outside the game system as they involve subjective interpretation of what constitutes "immediate" or "binding" terms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Transaction System

**User Story:** As a player, I want to exchange physical game components with other players so that I can trade resources and cards according to the game rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player proposes a component exchange THEN the system SHALL create a transaction with the proposing player and target player
2. WHEN a transaction is proposed THEN the system SHALL validate that both players are neighbors (per transaction rules)
3. WHEN a transaction includes trade goods THEN the system SHALL verify the proposing player has sufficient trade goods
4. WHEN a transaction includes promissory notes THEN the system SHALL verify the cards are available for exchange
5. WHEN a transaction is accepted THEN the system SHALL immediately execute the component exchange

### Requirement 2: Neighbor Validation for Transactions

**User Story:** As a player, I want component transactions to only be allowed between neighboring players so that the game rules are properly enforced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN players attempt a component transaction THEN the system SHALL verify they are neighbors
2. WHEN players are not neighbors THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction with an appropriate error message
3. WHEN players become neighbors during the game THEN the system SHALL allow transactions between them
4. WHEN players are no longer neighbors THEN the system SHALL prevent new transactions between them
5. WHEN the neighbor status is unclear THEN the system SHALL use the current adjacency rules to determine eligibility

### Requirement 3: Trade Goods Exchange

**User Story:** As a player, I want to exchange trade goods with neighboring players so that I can obtain resources for production and other game actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player proposes a trade goods exchange THEN the system SHALL verify they have sufficient trade goods
2. WHEN a trade goods exchange is accepted THEN the system SHALL transfer the specified trade goods between players
3. WHEN a player lacks sufficient trade goods THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction
4. WHEN trade goods are exchanged THEN the system SHALL update both players' resource pools immediately
5. WHEN a trade goods exchange is completed THEN the system SHALL log the transaction

### Requirement 4: Promissory Note Exchange

**User Story:** As a player, I want to exchange promissory notes with neighboring players so that I can trade future benefits and faction-specific advantages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player proposes a promissory note exchange THEN the system SHALL verify the note is available for trade
2. WHEN a promissory note exchange is accepted THEN the system SHALL transfer ownership of the note
3. WHEN a promissory note is already owned by another player THEN the system SHALL reject the exchange
4. WHEN a promissory note is exchanged THEN the system SHALL update the card ownership records
5. WHEN a promissory note exchange is completed THEN the system SHALL activate any immediate effects

### Requirement 5: Commodity Exchange

**User Story:** As a player, I want to exchange commodities with neighboring players so that I can convert them to trade goods and participate in the economy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player proposes a commodity exchange THEN the system SHALL verify they have sufficient commodities
2. WHEN a commodity exchange is accepted THEN the system SHALL transfer commodities and convert them to trade goods for the receiving player
3. WHEN a player lacks sufficient commodities THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction
4. WHEN commodities are exchanged THEN the system SHALL update commodity and trade goods pools appropriately
5. WHEN a commodity exchange is completed THEN the system SHALL log the conversion

### Requirement 6: Transaction Timing and Availability

**User Story:** As a player, I want to be able to propose component transactions at any time during the game so that I can engage in trade when strategic opportunities arise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it is any phase of the game THEN the system SHALL allow players to propose component transactions
2. WHEN a transaction is proposed during another player's turn THEN the system SHALL allow it without interrupting game flow
3. WHEN a transaction is accepted THEN the system SHALL execute it immediately
4. WHEN multiple transactions are pending THEN the system SHALL process them in the order they were accepted
5. WHEN a transaction affects the current game state THEN the system SHALL update all relevant systems immediately

### Requirement 7: Transaction History and Logging

**User Story:** As a player, I want to view my transaction history so that I can track my trades and economic relationships with other players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction is completed THEN the system SHALL record it in the game history
2. WHEN a player requests transaction history THEN the system SHALL display all past transactions involving that player
3. WHEN a transaction is logged THEN the system SHALL include the components exchanged, players involved, and timestamp
4. WHEN players need to reference past transactions THEN the system SHALL provide search and filter capabilities
5. WHEN a transaction fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason for debugging purposes

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a player, I want component transactions to work seamlessly with existing game systems so that trades properly affect my resources and capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trade goods are exchanged THEN the system SHALL update the resource management system
2. WHEN promissory notes are exchanged THEN the system SHALL update the card ownership system
3. WHEN commodities are exchanged THEN the system SHALL update both commodity and trade goods tracking
4. WHEN transactions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with fleet supply, production, and other resource-dependent systems
5. WHEN the game state changes due to transactions THEN the system SHALL notify all relevant game components
