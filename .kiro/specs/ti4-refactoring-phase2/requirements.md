# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project focuses on the second phase of refactoring the TI4 framework to improve code quality, maintainability, and extensibility. Building on the successful first phase that addressed unit statistics, movement rules, and error handling, this phase will implement advanced design patterns and architectural improvements to support the framework's continued growth and complexity.

The refactoring will address failing tests, implement missing design patterns, and establish robust foundations for AI integration and advanced game mechanics while maintaining backward compatibility and comprehensive test coverage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing tests to pass consistently, so that the framework maintains reliability and correctness during refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is run THEN all tests SHALL pass without failures
2. WHEN refactoring is performed THEN existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN test failures occur THEN they SHALL be investigated and resolved before proceeding with new features
4. IF tests reveal bugs THEN the underlying issues SHALL be fixed rather than modifying tests to pass
5. WHEN new code is added THEN test coverage SHALL be maintained or improved

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a framework architect, I want to implement the Command pattern for game actions, so that actions can be undone, logged, and replayed for debugging and AI training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game action is created THEN it SHALL implement the Command interface with execute and undo methods
2. WHEN an action is executed THEN the system SHALL store sufficient information to reverse the action
3. WHEN an undo is requested THEN the system SHALL restore the previous game state accurately
4. IF multiple actions are executed THEN they SHALL be undoable in reverse order (stack-based)
5. WHEN actions are logged THEN they SHALL include all necessary context for replay and analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game system designer, I want to implement the Observer pattern for game events, so that different components can react to game state changes without tight coupling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game event occurs THEN all registered observers SHALL be notified
2. WHEN observers are registered THEN they SHALL receive events relevant to their interests
3. WHEN game state changes THEN appropriate events SHALL be published to the event system
4. IF an observer fails THEN other observers SHALL continue to receive events
5. WHEN events are published THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for observers to react appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a test developer, I want a Builder pattern for complex game scenarios, so that test setup is more readable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating test scenarios THEN the builder SHALL provide a fluent interface for configuration
2. WHEN building game states THEN the builder SHALL validate configuration consistency
3. WHEN complex scenarios are needed THEN the builder SHALL support incremental construction
4. IF invalid configurations are provided THEN the builder SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN scenarios are built THEN they SHALL produce valid, consistent game states

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game flow manager, I want to implement a State Machine for game phases, so that phase transitions are more robust and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game phases change THEN transitions SHALL be validated against allowed state changes
2. WHEN invalid phase transitions are attempted THEN the system SHALL reject them with clear errors
3. WHEN phase-specific actions are attempted THEN the state machine SHALL enforce phase constraints
4. IF phase transition conditions are met THEN the system SHALL automatically progress to the next phase
5. WHEN debugging phase issues THEN the state machine SHALL provide clear state information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want the framework to handle large-scale scenarios efficiently, so that it can support complex AI training and analysis workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large numbers of game states THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable performance
2. WHEN memory usage grows THEN the system SHALL manage resources efficiently
3. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle them safely
4. IF performance bottlenecks exist THEN they SHALL be identified and optimized
5. WHEN scaling to multiple games THEN the system SHALL maintain isolation between game instances

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a framework maintainer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
2. WHEN exceptions are raised THEN they SHALL include actionable error messages
3. WHEN system state becomes inconsistent THEN appropriate recovery mechanisms SHALL be triggered
4. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL fail safely without corrupting game state
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN log levels SHALL provide appropriate detail without overwhelming output

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a code quality advocate, I want to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability, so that the framework is easier to extend and modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN similar code patterns exist THEN they SHALL be extracted into reusable components
2. WHEN magic numbers or strings are used THEN they SHALL be replaced with named constants
3. WHEN complex methods exist THEN they SHALL be broken down into smaller, focused functions
4. IF naming is unclear THEN variables and methods SHALL be renamed for clarity
5. WHEN code is refactored THEN the changes SHALL improve readability without changing behavior
