# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Rule 83: STRATEGY CARD in the TI4 AI system. Strategy cards are fundamental to TI4 gameplay, determining initiative order and providing powerful abilities that players can use during the action phase. This implementation will create the core strategy card system that manages card selection, state tracking, initiative determination, and ability resolution.

The strategy card system is essential for AI decision-making as it affects turn order, provides strategic abilities, and influences game flow. This system will integrate with existing strategic action mechanics (Rule 82) and support all eight strategy cards in the game.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Strategy Card System Foundation

**User Story:** As a game system, I want to manage the eight strategy cards and their states, so that players can select cards and the system can track ownership and exhaustion status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL create all eight strategy cards with correct names and initiative numbers
2. WHEN a strategy card is created THEN it SHALL have both readied and exhausted states with proper initiative numbers
3. WHEN querying available cards THEN the system SHALL return only cards in the common play area
4. IF a strategy card is in a player's play area THEN it SHALL not be available for selection by other players
5. WHEN getting a player's strategy card THEN the system SHALL return the card assigned to that player or null if none assigned

### Requirement 2: Strategy Phase Card Selection

**User Story:** As a player, I want to select a strategy card during the strategy phase, so that I can gain its abilities and determine my initiative order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the strategy phase begins THEN players SHALL be able to select cards in speaker order
2. WHEN a player selects a strategy card THEN it SHALL be moved from common play area to their play area
3. WHEN a strategy card is selected THEN it SHALL no longer be available to other players
4. IF a player tries to select an unavailable card THEN the system SHALL reject the selection
5. WHEN all players have selected cards THEN the strategy phase SHALL be complete

### Requirement 3: Initiative Order Determination

**User Story:** As the game system, I want to determine player initiative order based on strategy card numbers, so that action phase and status phase proceed in correct order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining initiative order THEN players SHALL be ordered by their strategy card's initiative number (1-8)
2. WHEN multiple players have cards THEN the system SHALL sort them from lowest to highest initiative number
3. WHEN getting initiative order THEN the system SHALL return player IDs in correct sequence
4. IF a player has no strategy card THEN they SHALL not appear in the initiative order
5. WHEN initiative order is requested THEN it SHALL be calculated from current card assignments

### Requirement 4: Strategy Card State Management

**User Story:** As the game system, I want to track strategy card readied/exhausted states, so that cards can be used once per round and readied between rounds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a strategy card is first assigned THEN it SHALL be in readied state
2. WHEN a strategic action is performed THEN the strategy card SHALL become exhausted
3. WHEN a card is exhausted THEN its primary ability SHALL not be usable again this round
4. WHEN the status phase occurs THEN all strategy cards SHALL be readied for the next round
5. IF querying card state THEN the system SHALL accurately report readied or exhausted status

### Requirement 5: Primary and Secondary Ability Framework

**User Story:** As a player, I want the system to enforce primary and secondary ability restrictions, so that I can only use my own card's primary ability and other players' secondary abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player activates their strategy card THEN they SHALL be able to use the primary ability
2. WHEN other players participate in a strategic action THEN they SHALL only access secondary abilities
3. IF a player tries to use primary ability of another player's card THEN the system SHALL reject the action
4. WHEN a strategic action occurs THEN secondary abilities SHALL be available to all other players
5. WHEN abilities are resolved THEN the system SHALL track which players have participated

### Requirement 6: Integration with Strategic Action System

**User Story:** As the game system, I want to integrate with the existing strategic action framework, so that strategy cards work seamlessly with the action resolution system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with strategic actions THEN the system SHALL work with existing StrategicActionManager
2. WHEN a strategic action is performed THEN it SHALL use the strategy card system for validation
3. WHEN strategy cards are activated THEN they SHALL follow the established strategic action workflow
4. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN strategic actions complete THEN strategy card states SHALL be updated appropriately

### Requirement 7: Multi-Player Game Support

**User Story:** As a game system, I want to support games with different player counts, so that strategy card selection works correctly for 3-8 player games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game has fewer than 8 players THEN some strategy cards SHALL remain unselected
2. WHEN players select cards THEN the system SHALL handle any number of players from 3-8
3. WHEN determining speaker order THEN the system SHALL support flexible player ordering
4. IF player count changes THEN the system SHALL adapt card availability accordingly
5. WHEN managing multiple players THEN each player SHALL have independent card selection

### Requirement 8: Strategy Card Information Access

**User Story:** As an AI player, I want to access strategy card information, so that I can make informed decisions about card selection and strategic planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying strategy cards THEN the system SHALL provide card names, initiative numbers, and current owners
2. WHEN evaluating card selection THEN AI SHALL have access to all available cards and their properties
3. WHEN planning strategy THEN AI SHALL know which cards other players have selected
4. IF requesting card details THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive card information
5. WHEN analyzing game state THEN strategy card assignments SHALL be clearly accessible

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and input validation, so that the strategy card system is robust and provides clear feedback for invalid operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid player IDs are provided THEN the system SHALL return descriptive error messages
2. WHEN invalid strategy card operations are attempted THEN the system SHALL prevent them gracefully
3. WHEN system state is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL detect and report the issue
4. IF edge cases occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without crashing
5. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL provide actionable feedback for resolution

### Requirement 10: Round Management and Card Reset

**User Story:** As the game system, I want to manage strategy cards across multiple rounds, so that cards are properly reset and redistributed each round.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new round begins THEN all strategy cards SHALL be returned to the common play area
2. WHEN cards are reset THEN all cards SHALL be readied and available for selection
3. WHEN round transitions occur THEN player assignments SHALL be cleared appropriately
4. IF a round reset is requested THEN the system SHALL restore initial card state
5. WHEN managing rounds THEN the system SHALL maintain proper card lifecycle management
