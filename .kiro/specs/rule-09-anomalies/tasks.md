# Implementation Plan - Rule 9: ANOMALIES

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the Rule 9: ANOMALIES design into a series of discrete, manageable coding tasks that build incrementally on the existing TI4 system architecture. Each task focuses on integration with existing systems while maintaining backward compatibility.
