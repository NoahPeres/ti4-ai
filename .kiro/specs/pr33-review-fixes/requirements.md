# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical issues identified in PR 33 code review feedback from CodeRabbit. The review identified several high-priority issues that need immediate attention to ensure system reliability and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Hook Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Kiro hook system to function properly so that automated quality checks run when files are edited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is edited THEN the subtask-quality-check hook SHALL trigger if the file matches the configured patterns
2. WHEN the patterns array is empty THEN the hook SHALL NOT trigger for any files
3. WHEN appropriate file patterns are configured THEN the hook SHALL trigger for relevant file types (Python, Markdown, TOML, etc.)

### Requirement 2: Fix Documentation Consistency

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want consistent documentation so that I can find the correct files to modify when working with enums.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation references enum definitions THEN it SHALL consistently point to the correct file location
2. WHEN troubleshooting guidance is provided THEN it SHALL align with the file organization section
3. WHEN multiple sections reference the same concept THEN they SHALL use consistent terminology and paths

### Requirement 3: Fix Ability Trigger System

**User Story:** As a game engine, I want abilities to trigger correctly during gameplay so that technology card effects work as intended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an ability is defined THEN it SHALL use canonical enum values for triggers
2. WHEN the game engine emits an event THEN abilities listening for that event SHALL activate
3. WHEN hardcoded trigger strings are used THEN they SHALL be replaced with enum values
4. WHEN tests verify ability triggering THEN they SHALL use the same trigger values as production code

### Requirement 4: Fix Ability Condition Validation

**User Story:** As a game system, I want ability conditions to be properly validated so that abilities only trigger when their requirements are met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an ability condition is not explicitly handled THEN the system SHALL fail closed (raise an error)
2. WHEN all ability conditions are implemented THEN each SHALL have explicit validation logic
3. WHEN an unsupported condition is encountered THEN the system SHALL raise a NotImplementedError with a descriptive message
4. WHEN ability validation occurs THEN it SHALL prevent silent failures that could allow invalid ability activations
