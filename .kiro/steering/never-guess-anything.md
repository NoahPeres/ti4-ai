   Add Rules to this file or a short description and have Kiro refine them for you:   I want to stress the importance of making assumptions and guessing: there have been many situations where we assume that something is one way when it is in fact another.

   A few golden rules for you:

   1. NEVER GUESS EVER. If you are not 100% sure of a fact to be true, you must RESEARCH - look up online, search concrete documentation that you have been provided, or (if required) ASK THE USER (this is ALWAYS preferable to getting something wrong)

   2. BEWARE OF ASSUMPTIONS. Do not assume that something is one way when the data suggests another thing. Example, you assumed that mypy was generating 'false positives' and so skipped over some errors it was raising, which turned out not do be the case on closer inspection. If you hypothesise this to be the case, you must PROVE it with DATA before you act on the inference.

   3. ASK FOR HELP. If you feel like there are gaps in your knowledge or you have insufficient context to perform a task, do NOT attempt to fill it in with 'vibes' - rather seek out accurate information (and document it for posterity), or ask the user to provide more comprehensive documentation.

   4. BE DILIGENT. Don't skip repetitive steps during your iteration cycle (e.g. linting, tests, mypy, etc.) because you assume that they will still pass (they probably won't!). Explicitly check everything every time.
