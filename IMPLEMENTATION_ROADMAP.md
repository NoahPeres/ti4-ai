## Implementation Guidelines

### Strict TDD Process
1. **RED**: Write failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass test
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **REPEAT**: For each small feature increment

### Quality Gates
- **100% test coverage** for all new code
- **Performance benchmarks** for adjacency/neighbor calculations
- **Integration tests** for cross-rule interactions
- **Documentation** for all public APIs

### Success Metrics
- **Overall Implementation**: Track progress toward 25% target
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 100% for new implementations
- **Performance**: Adjacency queries <1ms, neighbor queries <5ms
- **Integration**: All existing tests continue to pass

---

## Context for Future Development

This roadmap prioritizes **foundational spatial mechanics** that enable all higher-level TI4 gameplay. Once Phase 1 is complete:

- **Movement system** will have proper adjacency foundation
- **Combat system** can use accurate neighbor determination
- **Ability ranges** will work correctly with wormhole adjacency
- **AI planning** will have spatial awareness for strategic decisions

The **strict TDD approach** ensures each implementation is robust, testable, and maintainable, building toward a production-ready TI4 AI system.

## ðŸš€ Next Action: Identify Next Priority Rule

**Immediate Next Step**: Determine next rule to implement after Rule 58 completion
- **Status**: Rule 58 (MOVEMENT) has been completed âœ…
- **Dependencies**: All foundational rules (6, 60, 101, 61, 20, 58) now complete
- **Approach**: Review roadmap priorities and select next high-impact rule
- **Focus**: Continue with core game mechanics or strategic systems

**Context for Future Development**:
With foundational spatial mechanics, victory conditions, and command token system complete, implementing movement mechanics will enable tactical gameplay, combat positioning, and strategic unit deployment across the galaxy:
- Unit movement validation and path finding
- Fleet capacity and movement restrictions
- Tactical action system integration
- Command token consumption for movement
- AI decision-making for unit positioning
- Strategic movement planning for objectives
