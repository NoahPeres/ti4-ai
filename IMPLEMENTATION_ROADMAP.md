2. GREEN: Write minimal code to pass test
3. REFACTOR: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. REPEAT: For each small feature increment

### Integration Strategy
- Sequential dependency management
- Incremental integration with existing systems
- Comprehensive cross-rule interaction testing
- Maintain backward compatibility at all times

### Code Quality
- Strict typing with mypy
- Consistent formatting with ruff
- Comprehensive docstrings and comments
- Defensive programming with proper error handling
