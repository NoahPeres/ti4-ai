# TI4 AI Implementation Roadmap

## üéØ Overall Progress: 51/101 Rules (50.5% Complete)

### Last Updated
December 2025 (Post-Comprehensive Implementation Status Audit)

### Project Status
**CRITICAL PATH FOCUS**: Following the comprehensive implementation status audit, this roadmap has been completely restructured to prioritize the **4 critical blocking rules** (27, 92, 81, 89) that prevent complete gameplay functionality. The audit revealed exceptional quality in completed systems but identified specific gaps that block core game flow.

### Current Phase
**Critical Blocker Resolution** - Immediate focus on Rules 27, 92, 81, 89 as identified critical path

### Next Milestone
**Target**: Complete Basic Gameplay Loop (3 months)
**Success Criteria**: Full game playable from setup to victory with all critical systems operational

## üîß Development Guidelines

### TDD Process (Mandatory)
1. **RED**: Write failing test that demonstrates missing functionality
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **REPEAT**: For each small feature increment

### Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ for each new rule implementation
- **Type Safety**: Strict mypy compliance for all production code
- **Code Quality**: Ruff formatting and linting compliance
- **Documentation**: Complete LRR analysis for each rule
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms response time for all game actions

### Integration Strategy
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Implement rules in dependency order
- **Incremental Integration**: Continuous integration with existing systems
- **Regression Testing**: Comprehensive cross-rule interaction validation
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality must remain intact

### Risk Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
1. **Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Develop integration tests first
   - Contingency: Modular implementation with clear interfaces

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Mitigation: Performance benchmarks for each rule
   - Contingency: Optimization sprints between phases

3. **Quality Regression**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive regression test suite
   - Contingency: Automated quality gates blocking releases

#### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict adherence to critical path
   - Contingency: Feature freeze during critical phases

2. **Resource Constraints**
   - Mitigation: Focus on highest impact rules first
   - Contingency: Reduce scope to essential features only

3. **Timeline Pressure**
   - Mitigation: 20% buffer time in each phase
   - Contingency: Defer non-critical features to later phases

  - **Success Criteria**: Strategic depth and game balance operational
- **Month 8**: Production-ready system (63/101 rules - 62.4%)
  - **Success Criteria**: Complete feature set with advanced capabilities
- **Optional Phase 4**: Full rule coverage (101/101 rules - 100%)
  - **Priority**: Only if resources available after core completion

## üöÄ Strategic Recommendations (Based on Audit Findings)

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)
1. **Implement Critical Path Focus**
   - **STOP** all non-critical rule development immediately
   - **START** Rule 27 (Custodians Token) as highest priority
   - **ESTABLISH** critical path development workflow with 3-week cycles

2. **Restructure Team Allocation**
   - **ASSIGN** 50% of development resources to critical path lead
   - **FOCUS** remaining resources on strategic systems and quality assurance
   - **ESTABLISH** weekly progress reporting on critical blocking rules

3. **Implement Audit-Based Quality Gates**
   - **RAISE** test coverage requirement to 95% for critical path rules
   - **IMPLEMENT** comprehensive integration testing for complete gameplay scenarios
   - **ESTABLISH** performance benchmarking for end-to-end gameplay (<2s per action)

### Success Factors (Audit-Informed)
1. **Critical Path Focus**: 70% effort on 4 critical blocking rules (27, 92, 81, 89)
2. **Quality Excellence**: Maintain 95%+ test coverage for critical rules, 90%+ for others
3. **Integration First**: End-to-end gameplay validation as primary success metric
4. **Velocity Management**: Target 1 critical rule completion per 3-week cycle (including testing)

### Risk Mitigation (Based on Audit Complexity Assessment)
1. **Rule 27 Complexity**: Allocate full month due to game flow integration complexity
2. **Integration Risks**: Dedicate 15% of resources to integration specialist role
3. **Quality Regression**: Maintain comprehensive regression testing throughout
4. **Scope Management**: Defer all non-critical features until Phase 4 (optional)

### Long-Term Strategic Vision
This audit-based roadmap will deliver a **fully functional TI4 AI system in 3 months** (basic gameplay) and **production-ready system in 8 months**, compared to 18+ months with the previous approach. The focus on critical path completion ensures maximum impact per development hour invested.

**Key Success Metric**: Complete TI4 game playable from setup to victory by Month 3.
