3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **REPEAT**: For each small feature increment

### Quality Gates
- **100% test coverage** for all new code
- **Performance benchmarks** for adjacency/neighbor calculations
- **Integration tests** for cross-rule interactions
- **Documentation** for all public APIs

### Success Metrics
- **Overall Implementation**: Track progress toward 25% target
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 100% for new implementations
- **Performance**: Adjacency queries <1ms, neighbor queries <5ms
- **Integration**: All existing tests continue to pass

## Context for Future Development

This roadmap prioritizes **foundational spatial mechanics** that enable all higher-level TI4 gameplay. Once Phase 1 is complete:

- **Movement system** will have proper adjacency foundation
- **Combat system** can use accurate neighbor determination
- **Ability ranges** will work correctly with wormhole adjacency
- **AI planning** will have spatial awareness for strategic decisions

The **strict TDD approach** ensures each implementation is robust, testable, and maintainable, building toward a production-ready TI4 AI system.

- **Rule 48: INFLUENCE** - Influence system completion
- **Rule 50: INVASION COMBAT** - Invasion combat specifics

### **Implementation Strategy & Success Metrics**

#### **Quality Gates**
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 95%+ test coverage for each new rule
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive cross-rule interaction tests
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms response time for all game actions
- **Documentation**: Complete LRR analysis for each implemented rule

#### **Development Approach**
- **TDD Methodology**: Red-Green-Refactor for all implementations
- **Incremental Integration**: Each rule must integrate seamlessly with existing systems
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality must remain intact
- **Code Quality**: Maintain strict typing, linting, and formatting standards

#### **Milestone Targets**
- **6 months**: 50% rule coverage (50/101 rules)
- **12 months**: 75% rule coverage (75/101 rules)
- **18 months**: 100% rule coverage (101/101 rules)
- **Final Goal**: Complete, tournament-ready TI4 engine

This strategic plan provides a clear path from our current 29% coverage to full 101 rule implementation, prioritizing combat completion, political systems, and advanced mechanics in logical dependency order.

## 📋 Recently Completed: Rule 20 (COMMAND TOKENS)

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** (December 2024)
**Coverage**: Core mechanics implemented with comprehensive test suite

### Key Features Implemented:
- **CommandSheet class**: Token pool management (tactic, fleet, strategy)
- **Player integration**: Reinforcement tracking and token gain mechanics
- **Pool validation**: Proper error handling for invalid pools
- **TDD compliance**: 18 tests across 3 test files

### Test Coverage:
- `test_rule_20_command_tokens.py`: Core command sheet functionality (8 tests)
- `test_rule_20_reinforcement_limits.py`: Reinforcement system validation (4 tests)
- `test_rule_20_token_gain.py`: Token gain mechanics with pool choice (6 tests)

### Quality Metrics:
- **Type Safety**: Full mypy compliance with strict checking
- **Code Quality**: All linting and formatting standards met
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with Player class
- **Documentation**: Complete rule tracking in `.trae/lrr_analysis/`

The movement system (Rule 58) will provide the core tactical mechanics that enable dynamic gameplay and strategic positioning.
