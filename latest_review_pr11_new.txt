**Raw LRR text should remain verbatim; move tie‚Äëbreaking/status‚Äëphase note to analysis.**

This line adds interpretation to the ‚ÄúRaw LRR Text‚Äù block. Keep the raw quote exact and document clarifications in the analysis section.

Apply this diff to keep the raw block pure:

```diff
-98.7 The game ends immediately when one player has 10 victory points. If multiple players would simultaneously gain their 10th victory point, the player who is earliest in initiative order among those players is the winner; if this occurs when players are scoring during the Status Phase, resolve initiative order for that phase.
+98.7 The game ends immediately when one player has 10 victory points.
```

Please confirm the official wording for TI4 Rule 98.7:

üåê Web query:

```web
What is the exact text of Twilight Imperium 4th Edition Rule 98.7 regarding victory and simultaneous wins?
```

üí° Result:

98.7 The game ends immediately when one player has 10 victory points. If multiple players would simultaneously gain their 10th victory point, the player who is earliest in initiative order among those players is the winner; if this occurs when players do not have strategy cards, the player who is nearest the speaker (including the speaker) in clockwise order is the winner. [1][2]

</details>

**Restore exact Raw LRR wording; move interpretation to analysis.**

File: .trae/lrr_analysis/98_victory_points.md Lines: 20-20

Apply this replacement so the Raw LRR block matches the official text and remove the Status Phase interpretation from the raw quote:

```diff
-98.7 The game ends immediately when one player has 10 victory points. If multiple players would simultaneously gain their 10th victory point, the player who is earliest in initiative order among those players is the winner; if this occurs when players are scoring during the Status Phase, resolve initiative order for that phase.

Move any explanatory notes about resolving ties during the Status Phase into the analysis section.

.trae/lrr_analysis/98_victory_points.md around line 20: restore the Raw LRR
quote to the official wording exactly (replace the current line with the
official raw text verbatim) and remove the sentence that interprets resolving
ties during the Status Phase from the Raw LRR block; move that explanatory note
into the analysis section below the raw quote (create or append to an "Analysis"
paragraph) so the raw block contains only the official rule text and all
interpretation lives in the analysis section.

**Use status‚Äëphase initiative order for Status Phase tie‚Äëbreaks (GameState currently uses action‚Äëphase order).**

StrategyCardCoordinator exposes get_action_phase_initiative_order() and get_status_phase_initiative_order(); GameState currently calls get_action_phase_initiative_order() when sorting tied winners ‚Äî switch to get_status_phase_initiative_order() when resolving simultaneous 10‚ÄëVP wins that occur during the Status Phase.

Locations:

<summary>üß© Analysis chain</summary>

**Unify tie‚Äëbreak logic and avoid partial‚Äëassignment nondeterminism.**

Current logic duplicates initiative derivation and can skip winners lacking a strategy card assignment, falling back to an arbitrary list order. Use the existing sorter for deterministic ties and to centralize initiative logic.

**Unify tie‚Äëbreak logic ‚Äî call _sort_players_by_initiative_order(winners)**

get_winner duplicates initiative derivation and can omit winners that lack strategy‚Äëcard assignments; use the existing _sort_players_by_initiative_order to centralize logic and guarantee deterministic results.

In src/ti4/core/game_state.py around lines 122 to 159, get_winner duplicates
initiative-order derivation and can skip winners without strategy-card
assignments; replace the duplicated initiative-derivation and selection logic
with a single call to the existing _sort_players_by_initiative_order(winners)
helper and then iterate that sorted list to return the first matching winner
(fall back to winners[0] only if no match). Ensure the helper is passed the
winners list and that the method still respects strategy_card_coordinator,
strategy_card_assignments, and players order as the tie-breaker.

**Unify on Faction enum; replace string factions.**

Replace all literal faction strings with Faction.<NAME> (import from src.ti4.core.constants) to avoid mixed string/enum usage and type-check breakage.

Affected locations (examples; multiple occurrences in each):
- tests/test_game_controller.py: lines 40-42, 65-67, 104-105, 200-202, 223-231, 329-333, 377-380, 437-439
- tests/test_player_interface.py: 119, 130, 143, 155, 168, 182-183
- tests/test_integration.py: 183, 187
- tests/test_victory_conditions.py: 12, 19, 27, 66, 91, 124, 134, 144

- docs/REFACTORING_ANALYSIS.md: line 73
- latest_review_pr11.txt: line 607

Example change: faction="sol" -> faction=Faction.SOL. Import Faction where missing and run type checks.
