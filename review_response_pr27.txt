CodeRabbit Review Response for PR #27
=====================================

## Critical Issues (MUST FIX)

### 1. Leadership.py Line 139 - Planet exhaustion error handling (MAJOR)
**Issue**: Silent no-ops allow "free" influence without exhausting planets
**Decision**: AGREE - This is a critical bug that breaks game invariants
**Action**: Will implement hard errors for missing galaxy or unfound planets

### 2. Leadership.py Lines 367-417 - Duplicate planet prevention (CAUTION)
**Issue**: Duplicate planet names double-count influence and cause partial state changes
**Decision**: AGREE - This is a serious atomicity issue
**Action**: Will add duplicate detection with early rejection

### 3. Leadership.py Line 149 - Misleading error message
**Issue**: Shows "3 base" even when capped by reinforcements
**Decision**: AGREE - Confusing for users
**Action**: Will use max_base_tokens in error message

## Significant Improvements (SHOULD FIX)

### 4. Leadership.py Lines 111-123 - Token gain capping
**Issue**: Fails outright instead of capping to available reinforcements
**Decision**: PARTIALLY AGREE - Will cap additional tokens but keep validation for base tokens
**Reasoning**: Base tokens are guaranteed by the rules, additional tokens can be capped

### 5. Diplomacy.py Lines 164-186 - Token consumption order
**Issue**: Places token before consuming from supply
**Decision**: AGREE - Should consume first, then place
**Action**: Will swap order and check return values

### 6. Leadership.py Lines 124-131 - Atomic operations
**Issue**: Risk of partial side effects if gain_command_token fails
**Decision**: PARTIALLY AGREE - Will improve error handling but full rollback is complex
**Action**: Will add better validation before state changes

## Code Quality Improvements (WILL FIX)

### 7. Diplomacy.py - Various nitpicks
- Clarify kwargs documentation ✓
- Simplify planet control checks ✓
- Rename loop variables for clarity ✓
- Return readied planets in secondary result ✓
- Remove redundant galaxy guards ✓

### 8. Leadership.py - Type improvements
- Use Sequence[str] instead of list[str] ✓
- Import Sequence ✓

## Optional Improvements (WILL NOT IMPLEMENT)

### 9. Player.get_reinforcements() accessor
**Decision**: DISAGREE - Direct attribute access is fine for internal code
**Reasoning**: Adding getters for simple attributes adds unnecessary complexity

## Summary
- Critical fixes: 3 items
- Significant improvements: 3 items
- Code quality: 6 items
- Total changes: 12 items to implement

All changes will maintain backward compatibility and test coverage.
