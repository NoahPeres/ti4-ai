# LRR Analysis Files Needing Updates

Based on the comprehensive implementation status audit, the following LRR analysis files require updates to reflect current implementation status and identified gaps.

## Critical Updates Required

### Missing LRR Analysis Files
These rules have implementations but lack corresponding LRR analysis documentation:

1. **Rule 70: Purge** - No analysis file exists
   - Status: Not Started implementation
   - Priority: Medium
   - Needs: Complete analysis file creation

2. **Rule 71: Readied** - No analysis file exists
   - Status: Not Started implementation
   - Priority: High
   - Needs: Complete analysis file creation

3. **Rule 72: Reinforcements** - No analysis file exists
   - Status: Not Started implementation
   - Priority: High
   - Needs: Complete analysis file creation

4. **Rule 73: Relics** - No analysis file exists
   - Status: Not Started implementation
   - Priority: Medium
   - Needs: Complete analysis file creation

### Outdated Analysis Files
These files exist but don't reflect current implementation status:

#### Fully Implemented Rules Needing Analysis Updates
1. **Rule 02: Action Cards** (`.trae/lrr_analysis/02_action_cards.md`)
   - Current Status: Fully Implemented (39/39 tests passing)
   - Analysis Gap: May not reflect complete implementation
   - Update Needed: Confirm analysis reflects full implementation status

2. **Rule 05: Active System** (`.trae/lrr_analysis/05_active_system.md`)
   - Current Status: Fully Implemented via Rule 89 integration
   - Analysis Gap: May not reflect tactical action integration
   - Update Needed: Document complete tactical action integration

3. **Rule 06: Adjacency** (`.trae/lrr_analysis/06_adjacency.md`)
   - Current Status: Fully Implemented with wormhole support
   - Analysis Gap: May not reflect complete wormhole adjacency
   - Update Needed: Document comprehensive adjacency mechanics

4. **Rule 25: Control** (`.trae/lrr_analysis/25_control.md`)
   - Current Status: Fully Implemented with exploration integration
   - Analysis Gap: May not reflect complete control mechanics
   - Update Needed: Document full planet control system

5. **Rule 61: Objective Cards** (`.trae/lrr_analysis/61_objectives.md`)
   - Current Status: 85% Implemented with extensive test coverage
   - Analysis Gap: May not reflect current implementation progress
   - Update Needed: Document current objective system status

#### Partially Implemented Rules Needing Analysis Updates
1. **Rule 01: Abilities** (`.trae/lrr_analysis/01_abilities.md`)
   - Current Status: Partially Implemented (foundation solid, advanced features missing)
   - Analysis Gap: May not identify specific missing components
   - Update Needed: Document implemented vs missing ability features

2. **Rule 03: Action Phase** (`.trae/lrr_analysis/03_action_phase.md`)
   - Current Status: Partially Implemented (core loop functional, edge cases incomplete)
   - Analysis Gap: May not reflect current implementation state
   - Update Needed: Document functional vs missing action phase features

3. **Rule 08: Agenda Phase** (`.trae/lrr_analysis/08_agenda_phase.md`)
   - Current Status: Partially Implemented (voting mechanics complete, election mechanics missing)
   - Analysis Gap: May not reflect voting system completeness
   - Update Needed: Document implemented voting vs missing election features

4. **Rule 27: Custodians Token** (`.trae/lrr_analysis/27_custodians_token.md`)
   - Current Status: Not Started (critical gap blocking agenda phase)
   - Analysis Gap: May not emphasize critical blocking nature
   - Update Needed: Highlight critical priority and blocking effects

#### Strategy Card Analysis Updates
1. **Rule 66: Politics** (`.trae/lrr_analysis/66_politics.md`)
   - Current Status: Fully Implemented (18 passing tests)
   - Analysis Gap: May not reflect complete implementation
   - Update Needed: Document full Politics strategy card implementation

2. **Rule 83: Strategy Cards** (`.trae/lrr_analysis/83_strategy_cards.md`)
   - Current Status: Framework complete, specific cards vary
   - Analysis Gap: May not reflect current card-specific implementation status
   - Update Needed: Document per-card implementation status

## Analysis Quality Standards

### Required Analysis Components
Each LRR analysis file should include:
1. **Implementation Status Summary** - Clear status classification
2. **Implemented Features List** - What currently works
3. **Missing Components List** - What needs implementation
4. **Test Coverage Summary** - Current test status
5. **Integration Points** - How rule connects to other systems
6. **Priority Assessment** - Implementation priority level
7. **Next Steps** - Specific implementation recommendations

### Status Classification Standards
- **Fully Implemented**: All sub-rules implemented with comprehensive tests
- **Partially Implemented**: Core mechanics work but gaps remain
- **Spec Only**: Requirements/design exist but no implementation
- **Not Started**: No evidence of implementation or planning

### Priority Classification Standards
- **Critical**: Core game mechanics, blocking other implementations
- **High**: Important features affecting gameplay
- **Medium**: Supporting features, quality of life improvements
- **Low**: Edge cases, optimization opportunities

## Update Timeline Recommendations

### Phase 1: Critical Missing Files (Week 1)
- Create analysis files for Rules 70, 71, 72, 73
- Focus on documenting current gaps and implementation requirements

### Phase 2: Fully Implemented Updates (Week 2)
- Update analysis for Rules 2, 5, 6, 25, 61, 66
- Ensure analysis reflects complete implementation status

### Phase 3: Partially Implemented Updates (Week 3)
- Update analysis for Rules 1, 3, 8, 27, 83
- Document specific implemented vs missing features

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance (Week 4)
- Review all updated analysis files for consistency
- Ensure all files follow quality standards
- Cross-reference with implementation audit findings
