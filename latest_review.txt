`9-10`: **Fix markdown emphasis formatting for section headings**

The linting tool correctly identifies these lines as using emphasis instead of proper headings. This affects readability and document structure.



```diff
-**Authorization Header Fix**
+## Authorization Header Fix
```

Similarly fix all other emphasized text that should be headings (lines 13, 18, 25, 28, 32, 39).

`53-58`: **Summary claims don't align with actual scope of changes**

The summary mentions "All 13 review feedback items" but the AI summary indicates this PR implements major new features like burst-icon mechanics, space combat engine, and unit stats overhaul - not just review feedback fixes.



This appears to be documentation for a different change set than what's being reviewed in this PR.

---

`46-49`: **Update test count in review_response_summary.md**

This PR added tests (tests/test_rule_18_burst_icons.py, tests/test_rule_78_space_combat.py) but the summary still lists "1037 tests" (review_response_summary.md, lines 46â€“49). The provided verification script failed to compute the total (wargs: command not found; many grep processes terminated by SIGPIPE). Update the total test count and coverage to match the repo or run a corrected local count.

<summary>.pre-commit-config.yaml (1)</summary><blockquote>

`14-15`: **LGTM! Proper commit message validation integration**

The addition of `check-commit-message` hook with commit-msg stage correctly enables commit message validation as part of the pre-commit workflow.

</blockquote></details>
<details>
<summary>Makefile (7)</summary><blockquote>

`1-2`: **LGTM! Essential shell hardening implemented**

Adding bash with `-euo pipefail` prevents silent failures and improves error handling across all Make targets - a critical improvement for build reliability.

---

`8-9`: **LGTM! Self-documenting help system implemented**

The implementation correctly uses inline comments for automatic help generation, solving the checkmake body length issue while improving maintainability.

---

`25-27`: **LGTM! Unified lint-fix target with formatting**

Combining linting fixes with code formatting in a single target improves developer workflow by providing one-stop fixing.

---

`32-33`: **LGTM! DRY principle applied for format checking**

Creating a dedicated `format-check` target eliminates duplication between `check-all` and `quality-gate` targets while maintaining clarity.

---

`49-49`: **LGTM! Security gate properly fails on findings**

The Bandit command now correctly fails on security issues with `-ll -ii` flags for high-severity/high-confidence filtering, addressing the previous review concern.

---

`56-57`: **LGTM! Comprehensive pre-commit hook installation**

Installing both standard and commit-msg hooks aligns with the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` changes and provides complete pre-commit integration.

---

`59-60`: **LGTM! Pre-commit maintenance automation**

The `pre-commit-autoupdate` target enables easy hook version maintenance, improving developer experience and security posture.

<details>
<summary>scripts/fetch_pr_review.py (8)</summary><blockquote>

`1-24`: **LGTM! Well-structured CLI with comprehensive documentation**

The script provides clear usage instructions, environment variable support, and helpful examples. The import organization and module docstring are excellent.

---

`41-52`: **LGTM! Centralized header management resolves duplication**

The `_headers()` method correctly centralizes header creation and uses consistent Bearer token authentication, addressing previous review concerns about header duplication and auth scheme consistency.

---

`58-70`: **LGTM! Robust request handling with proper timeout**

The timeout parameter (15 seconds) prevents hanging on network stalls, and the error handling correctly maps HTTP and network errors to meaningful messages.

---

`93-96`: **LGTM! Proper payload validation for API responses**

The type guard correctly handles the expectation that paginated endpoints return lists, preventing corruption from unexpected response types.

---

`138-139`: **LGTM! Pagination properly implemented**

Using `_get_all_pages()` ensures complete review collection for large PRs, addressing the previous concern about missing reviews beyond the first 100.

---

`183-184`: **LGTM! Unified pagination for review comments**

Reusing `_get_all_pages()` eliminates manual pagination code and ensures consistent behavior across all paginated endpoints.

---

`227-229`: **LGTM! Robust line number fallback logic**

The fallback logic trying `line`, `original_line`, and `position` fields handles different GitHub API response formats effectively.

---

`258-258`: **LGTM! Proper working directory usage**

Using `os.getcwd()` correctly detects the repository from the current working directory, supporting various invocation methods including symlinks.

<summary>latest_review.txt (3)</summary><blockquote>

`563-609`: **Review comment references non-existent code issues**

The detailed comment mentions authorization header mismatches and "token" vs "Bearer" schemes (lines 571-574), but examining `scripts/fetch_pr_review.py` shows it already uses Bearer tokens consistently throughout. This appears to be stale review feedback.



The actual code uses `f'Bearer {self.token}'` consistently in the `_headers()` method.

---

`617-657`: **Review comment about missing timeout is outdated**

The comment suggests adding timeout to urlopen calls, but the current code already includes `timeout=15` in both `_make_request` and `_get_all_pages` methods. This review feedback appears to have been already addressed.

---

`666-719`: **Review comment about payload validation is resolved**

The comment suggests adding type guards for non-list payloads, but the current code already implements proper validation in lines 94-95 of `_get_all_pages()` with appropriate error handling for unexpected payload types.
