# Rule 95: TRANSPORT

## Category Overview
When a ship moves, it may transport any combination of fighters and ground forces, but the number of units it transports cannot exceed that ship's capacity value.

**Implementation Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All sub-rules implemented with comprehensive test coverage

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 95.0 - Transport Capacity (Implicit)
- **Rule**: Ships can transport fighters and ground forces up to their capacity value
- **Implementation**: `TransportManager.can_transport_units()` validates capacity limits
- **Test Coverage**: `TestRule95TransportCapacityValidation` - 100% coverage
- **Key Components**:
  - `TRANSPORTABLE_UNIT_TYPES` constant defines valid unit types
  - Capacity validation prevents exceeding ship limits
  - Only fighters and ground forces can be transported

### 95.1 - Pickup and Transport
- **Note**: The ship can pick up and transport fighters and ground forces when it moves from the active system, the system it started movement in, and each system it moves through
- **Implementation**: `TransportManager.validate_pickup_during_movement()` handles pickup validation
- **Test Coverage**: `TestRule95CommandTokenRestrictions` - comprehensive pickup scenarios
- **Key Components**:
  - Starting system pickup always allowed
  - Active system pickup always allowed
  - Intermediate system pickup subject to command token restrictions

### 95.2 - Transport Movement
- **Note**: Any fighters and ground forces that a ship transports must move with the ship and remain in the space area of a system
- **Implementation**: `TransportRules` class manages movement constraints
- **Test Coverage**: `TestRule95TransportMovementConstraints` and `TestRule95TransportDestruction`
- **Key Components**:
  - `TransportRules.validate_movement_constraints()` ensures units move with ship
  - `TransportRules.get_units_in_space_area()` tracks space area placement
  - `TransportRules.handle_transport_ship_destruction()` handles ship destruction
  - Transported units cannot retreat separately from transport ship

### 95.3 - Pickup Restrictions
- **Note**: Fighters and ground forces cannot be picked up from a system that contains one of their faction's command tokens other than the active system
- **Implementation**: `TransportManager.can_pickup_from_system()` enforces command token restrictions
- **Test Coverage**: `TestRule95CommandTokenRestrictions` - all restriction scenarios
- **Key Components**:
  - Command token validation prevents pickup from restricted systems
  - Active system exception allows pickup despite command tokens
  - Comprehensive error handling with `TransportPickupError`

### 95.4 - Landing Ground Forces
- **Note**: A player can land ground forces on a planet in a system during the "Invasion" step of a tactical action
- **Implementation**: Integration with `InvasionController` for ground force landing
- **Test Coverage**: `TestRule95GroundForceLandingIntegration` - invasion step integration
- **Key Components**:
  - Ground forces can land during invasion step
  - Fighters remain in space area during invasion
  - Mixed transport units handled correctly (only ground forces land)

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Classes
1. **TransportManager**: Central coordinator for transport operations
   - `can_transport_units()`: Capacity validation
   - `load_units()` / `unload_units()`: Unit loading/unloading
   - `validate_pickup_during_movement()`: Pickup validation

2. **TransportState**: Tracks transported units and ship state
   - Immutable state tracking
   - Capacity management
   - Unit ownership validation

3. **TransportRules**: Movement and constraint validation
   - Movement constraint validation
   - Space area unit tracking
   - Ship destruction handling

4. **FleetTransportManager**: Multi-ship transport coordination
   - Fleet-wide capacity calculation
   - Unit distribution optimization
   - Transport coordination across multiple ships

### Exception Hierarchy
- `TransportError`: Base transport exception
- `TransportCapacityError`: Capacity limit violations
- `TransportPickupError`: Pickup restriction violations
- `TransportMovementError`: Movement constraint violations

### Integration Points
- **Movement System**: Enhanced `TransportValidator` and `MovementOperation`
- **Fleet System**: Integration with `Fleet.get_total_capacity()`
- **Invasion System**: Ground force landing during invasion step
- **Validation System**: Comprehensive validation layers
