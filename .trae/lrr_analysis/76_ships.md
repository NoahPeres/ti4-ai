# Rule 76: SHIPS

## Category Overview
**Priority**: High  
**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Test Coverage**: âœ… **Comprehensive (18 tests)** 

Ships are the primary unit type for space-based gameplay in TI4. This rule defines ship mechanics, fleet pool limits, and ship attributes that are fundamental to movement, combat, and strategic positioning.

**Implementation Priority**: High - Foundation layer rule that enables space-based gameplay mechanics.

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 76.0 - Ship Definition
**Raw LRR Text**: "A ship is a unit type consisting of carriers, cruisers, dreadnoughts, destroyers, fighters, and war suns. Each race also has a unique flagship."

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: High  
**Details**: Implemented `ShipManager.is_ship()` method that identifies all seven ship types and distinguishes them from ground forces and structures.

### 76.1 - Ship Placement
**Raw LRR Text**: "Ships are always placed in space."

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: High  
**Details**: Implemented `can_place_ship_in_space()` and `can_place_ship_on_planet()` methods that enforce space-only placement for ships.

### 76.2 - Fleet Pool Limits
**Raw LRR Text**: "A player can have a number of ships in a system equal to or less than the number of command tokens in that player's fleet pool."

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: High  
**Details**: Implemented `can_add_ship_to_system()` and `count_non_fighter_ships_in_system()` methods that enforce fleet pool limits. Fighters properly excluded from fleet pool counting.

### 76.3 - Ship Attributes
**Raw LRR Text**: "Ships can have any number of the following attributes: cost, combat, move, and capacity. These attributes are shown on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards."

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: High  
**Details**: Implemented `ship_has_*_attribute()` methods for cost, combat, move, and capacity attributes. Full integration with existing UnitStatsProvider system.
