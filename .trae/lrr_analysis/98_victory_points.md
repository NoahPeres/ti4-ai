98 VICTORY POINTS
The first player to gain 10 victory points wins the game.
98.1 Players gain victory points in a variety of ways. A common way that a player can gain victory points is by scoring objectives.
98.2 Each player uses the victory point track to indicate the number of victory points they have gained.
a If the players are using the 14-space side of the victory point track, the game ends and a player wins when they have 14 victory points instead of 10.
98.3 Each player places one of their control tokens on space "0" of the victory point track during setup.
98.4 When a player gains a victory point, they advance their control token a number of spaces along the victory point track equal to the number of victory points gained.
a A player's control token must always be on the space of the victory point track that shows a number that matches the number of victory points that player has gained during the game. A player cannot have more than 10 victory points.
98.5 If an ability refers to the player with the "most" or "fewest" victory points, and more than one player is tied in that respect, the effect applies to all of the tied players.
98.6 If a player gains a victory point from a law, and that law is discarded, that player does not lose that victory point.
98.7 The game ends immediately when one player has 10 victory points. If multiple players would simultaneously gain their 10th victory point, the player who is earliest in initiative order among those players is the winner; if this occurs when players

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 98.1 - Victory Point Sources (✅ Implemented)
**Status**: Fully implemented  
**Implementation**: Multiple victory point sources supported through objective system  
**Coverage**: Objective scoring, various victory point award mechanisms  
**Validation**: Comprehensive test coverage for different scoring methods

### 98.2 - Victory Point Track (⚠️ Partially Implemented)
**Status**: Partially implemented  
**Implementation**: Victory point tracking exists in `GameState`  
**Missing**: No visual victory point track UI, no 14-point variant support  
**Coverage**: Core tracking works but lacks visual representation

### 98.3 - Setup Initialization (✅ Implemented)
**Status**: Fully implemented  
**Implementation**: Players start with 0 victory points in `GameState`  
**Coverage**: Proper initialization during game setup  
**Validation**: Test coverage confirms zero-point start

### 98.4 - Victory Point Advancement (✅ Implemented)
**Status**: Fully implemented  
**Implementation**: `award_victory_points()` method with proper tracking  
**Coverage**: Correct point advancement and state management  
**Limitation**: No enforcement of 10-point maximum in current implementation

### 98.5 - Tie Resolution (❌ Not Implemented)
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Missing**: No tie-breaking logic for "most" or "fewest" victory points  
**Impact**: Abilities referencing victory point comparisons may not work correctly  
**Required**: Tie resolution system for victory point-based effects

### 98.6 - Law Victory Points (❌ Not Implemented)
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Missing**: No law system or persistent victory point tracking from laws  
**Impact**: Law-based victory points cannot be awarded or maintained  
**Required**: Law system integration with victory point persistence

### 98.7 - Game End Conditions (⚠️ Partially Implemented)
**Status**: Partially implemented  
**Implementation**: Basic 10-point win condition exists  
**Missing**: Initiative order tie-breaking, simultaneous victory resolution  
**Coverage**: Simple win detection but lacks complex tie scenarios

- Victory point maximum enforcement (10-point cap)
- Tie resolution for "most/fewest" victory point effects
- Visual victory point track synchronization

## Implementation Files

### Core Implementation
- `src/ti4/core/game_state.py`: Victory point tracking and win condition checking
- `src/ti4/core/objective.py`: Objective system for victory point awards
- `tests/test_victory_conditions.py`: Comprehensive victory point testing
- `src/ti4/core/constants.py`: Victory point constants and thresholds

### Supporting Files

## Notable Details

### Strengths
- Robust victory point tracking system with immutable state management
- Comprehensive test coverage for basic victory mechanics
- Clean separation of victory point logic from game state
- Good integration with objective scoring system
- Proper initialization and basic win condition detection

### Areas Needing Attention
- No visual victory point track representation
- Missing 14-point victory variant support
- Incomplete tie-breaking mechanisms for simultaneous victories
- No law system integration for persistent victory points
- Missing enforcement of 10-point maximum
- No support for victory point-based ability tie resolution

## Action Items

### High Priority
1. **Implement initiative order tie-breaking** - Handle simultaneous victory scenarios
2. **Add 14-point victory variant** - Support alternative victory conditions
3. **Create victory point track UI** - Visual representation of player progress

### Medium Priority  
4. **Implement tie resolution system** - Handle "most/fewest" victory point effects
5. **Add victory point maximum enforcement** - Prevent exceeding 10 points
6. **Integrate law system** - Support law-based victory points with persistence

### Low Priority
7. **Add victory point animations** - Visual feedback for point gains
8. **Implement victory point history** - Track scoring progression over time
9. **Add victory condition variants** - Support custom victory thresholds

## Priority Assessment
**Priority**: High  
**Implementation Status**: 75%  
**Rationale**: Core victory point mechanics work well with proper tracking and basic win conditions. Missing primarily advanced scenarios (ties, variants) and visual elements. Critical for game completion but functional for basic gameplay. High priority due to fundamental role in determining game winners.
