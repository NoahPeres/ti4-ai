# Rule 11: ASTEROID FIELD

## Category Overview
**Rule Type**: Anomaly
**Complexity**: Low
**Dependencies**: Movement, Anomalies, System Tiles
**Implementation Status**: 游댮 Not Implemented

An asteroid field is an anomaly that affects movement by completely blocking ship movement through or into the system. This is one of the four types of anomalies in TI4, identified by its distinctive art and red border.

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 11.1 Movement Restriction 游댮 HIGH PRIORITY
**Raw LRR Text**: "A ship cannot move through or into an asteroid field."

**Implementation Status**: 游댮 Not Implemented
**Current State**: `AnomalyRule` class exists but returns `True` for all movement checks
**Missing Elements**:
- Asteroid field detection in systems
- Movement blocking logic for asteroid fields
- Integration with movement validation system

**Key Requirements**:
- **Absolute Movement Block**: Ships cannot enter asteroid field systems at all
- **No Transit**: Ships cannot move through asteroid field systems to reach other destinations
- **Complete Restriction**: No exceptions or special abilities override this rule
