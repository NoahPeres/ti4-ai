# LRR Rule Analysis: Section 8 - AGENDA PHASE

## Category Overview
The agenda phase is where players cast votes on agenda cards that can change the rules of the game. This phase is triggered after the custodians token is removed from Mecatol Rex and involves resolving two agendas per round. Players use their planets' influence values to cast votes, with the speaker controlling agenda revelation and tie-breaking.

## Sub-Rules Analysis
