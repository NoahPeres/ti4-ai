# LRR Rule Analysis: Section 7 - AGENDA CARD

## Category Overview
Agenda cards represent galactic laws and policies that can permanently change the rules of the game or provide one-time effects. During each agenda phase, players cast votes for specific outcomes on two agenda cards. This system is fundamental to the political aspect of Twilight Imperium 4th Edition.
