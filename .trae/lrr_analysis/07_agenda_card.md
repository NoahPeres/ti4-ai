# LRR Rule Analysis: Section 7 - AGENDA CARD

## Category Overview
Agenda cards represent galactic laws and policies that can permanently change the rules of the game or provide one-time effects. During each agenda phase, players cast votes for specific outcomes on two agenda cards. This system is fundamental to the political aspect of Twilight Imperium 4th Edition.

**Implementation Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No law discard system or effect removal
- **Tests**: No discard effect tests
- **Assessment**: Law lifecycle management missing
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Dependencies**: Requires discard pile and effect cleanup system
- **Notes**: Laws can be removed by various game effects

### 7.7 Directive One-Time Effects üî¥ HIGH
**Raw LRR Text**: "Directives provide one-time game effects."

**Implementation Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No directive system
- **Tests**: No directive tests
- **Assessment**: One-time political effects missing
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Dependencies**: Requires directive resolution system
- **Notes**: Directives are resolved once and discarded

### 7.8 Directive Resolution üî¥ HIGH
**Raw LRR Text**: "When resolving a directive, players resolve the outcome that received the most votes and discard the agenda card."

**Implementation Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No directive resolution or auto-discard
- **Tests**: No directive resolution tests
- **Assessment**: Directive lifecycle not implemented
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Dependencies**: Requires voting system and automatic discard
- **Notes**: Directives always go to discard pile after resolution

## Dependencies Summary
