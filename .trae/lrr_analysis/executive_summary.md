## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. Focus on high-priority rules with <25% implementation
2. Implement core adjacency and movement mechanics (Rules 6, 58, 101)
3. Add comprehensive test coverage for combat systems
4. Complete strategy card implementations (Rules 83, 84, 91, 92, 99)

### Medium-Term Goals
1. Achieve 50%+ implementation across all high-priority rules
2. Complete faction-specific mechanics and abilities
3. Implement advanced game mechanics (exploration, relics, leaders)
4. Add UI components for all implemented mechanics

### Long-Term Objectives
1. Achieve 80%+ overall implementation coverage
2. Complete all edge cases and advanced scenarios
3. Optimize performance for complex game states
4. Add comprehensive documentation and debugging tools

## Progress Tracking

This summary should be regenerated regularly to track implementation progress. Key metrics to monitor:

- **Overall Implementation Percentage**: Target 80%+ for production readiness
- **High Priority Rule Coverage**: Target 90%+ completion for core gameplay
- **Test Coverage**: Target comprehensive test suites for all implemented rules
- **Action Item Completion**: Track and prioritize remaining implementation tasks
