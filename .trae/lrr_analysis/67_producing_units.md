# Rule 67: PRODUCING UNITS

## Category Overview
**Priority**: High
**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Test Coverage**: âœ… **Comprehensive (17 tests)**

The primary way that a player produces new units is by resolving the "Production" abilities of existing units during a tactical action. However, other game effects also allow players to produce units. This is a core game mechanic that enables unit expansion and strategic positioning.

**Implementation Complete**: Core sub-rules implemented with full TDD methodology and comprehensive test coverage.

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 67.1 - Unit Cost
**Raw LRR Text**: "Each unit has cost value on faction sheet or technology card; must spend resources equal to or greater than cost"

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: High
**Details**: Implemented `can_afford_unit()` method that validates resource requirements against unit costs using the existing UnitStatsProvider system.

### 67.2 - Dual Unit Production
**Raw LRR Text**: "Cost with two icons (fighters/infantry) produces two units for that cost"

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: High
**Details**: Implemented `get_units_produced_for_cost()` method that returns 2 for fighters/infantry and 1 for all other units.

### 67.3 - Tactical Action Production
**Raw LRR Text**: "Production during tactical action follows Production ability rules for placement in active system"

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: Medium
**Details**: Implemented `ProductionStep` class that integrates with tactical action system. Includes production unit detection and framework for full tactical action production workflow.

### 67.4 - Non-Tactical Production
**Raw LRR Text**: "Production outside tactical action specifies number and placement location"

**Implementation Status**: ðŸ”„ **FRAMEWORK READY**
**Priority**: Medium
**Details**: Framework implemented. Specific non-tactical production rules can be added as needed.

### 67.5 - Reinforcement Limits
**Raw LRR Text**: "Players limited by units in reinforcements; can remove units from non-command token systems to produce"

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: High
**Details**: Implemented `can_produce_from_reinforcements()` method that validates production against available reinforcement units, including dual unit production calculations.

### 67.6 - Ship Production Restriction
**Raw LRR Text**: "Cannot produce ships in system containing other players' ships"

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: High
**Details**: Implemented `can_produce_ships_in_system()` method that prevents ship production when enemy ships are present in the same system.
