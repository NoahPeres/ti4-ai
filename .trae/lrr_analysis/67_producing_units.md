# Rule 67: PRODUCING UNITS

## Category Overview
The primary way that a player produces new units is by resolving the "Production" abilities of existing units during a tactical action. However, other game effects also allow players to produce units.

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 67.1 - Unit Cost
- **Note**: Each unit has cost value on faction sheet or technology card; must spend resources equal to or greater than cost

### 67.2 - Dual Unit Production
- **Note**: Cost with two icons (fighters/infantry) produces two units for that cost

### 67.3 - Tactical Action Production
- **Note**: Production during tactical action follows Production ability rules for placement in active system

### 67.4 - Non-Tactical Production
- **Note**: Production outside tactical action specifies number and placement location

### 67.5 - Reinforcement Limits
- **Note**: Players limited by units in reinforcements; can remove units from non-command token systems to produce

### 67.6 - Ship Production Restriction
- **Note**: Cannot produce ships in system containing other players' ships
