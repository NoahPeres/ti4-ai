75 RESOURCES
Resources represent a planet's material value and industry. Many game effects, such as producing units, require players to spend resources.

75.1 A planet's resources are the leftmost value that is surrounded by a yellow border on both the system tile and planet card.

75.2 A player spends a planet's resources by exhausting that planet's card.

75.3 A player can spend a trade good as if it were one resource.
