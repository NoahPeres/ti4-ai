### 90.5 - Direct Technology Gain ðŸ”„ **FRAMEWORK READY**
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ Framework implemented in `TechnologyManager.gain_technology()`
- **Note**: If an ability instructs a player to gain a technology, they take it from their deck and place it in play area, ignoring prerequisites
- **Implementation**: Method exists but needs integration with specific abilities

### 90.6 - Unit Upgrades âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Status**: âœ… Implemented in `TechnologyManager.is_unit_upgrade()`
- **Note**: Some technologies are unit upgrades that share a name with a unit printed on player's faction sheet
- **Tests**: `test_unit_upgrade_technologies_identified()` and `test_unit_upgrade_affects_unit_type()` in `test_rule_90_technology.py`

### 90.7 - Technology Colors âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Status**: âœ… Implemented in `TechnologyManager.get_technology_color()`
- **Note**: Each technology that is not a unit upgrade has a colored symbol indicating that technology's color
- **Tests**: `test_technologies_have_colors()` in `test_rule_90_technology.py`

### 90.8 - Prerequisites âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Status**: âœ… Implemented in `TechnologyManager.get_technology_prerequisites()` and `can_research_technology()`
- **Note**: Most technology cards have a column of colored symbols displayed in the lower-left corner as prerequisites
- **Tests**: `test_technologies_have_prerequisites()`, `test_can_research_technology_with_prerequisites()`, `test_cannot_research_technology_without_prerequisites()` in `test_rule_90_technology.py`

### 90.9 - Researching Technology âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Status**: âœ… Implemented in `ResearchTechnologyAction` with full game state integration
- **Note**: A player can research technology by resolving primary or secondary ability of "Technology" strategy card or other game effects
- **Tests**: Integration tests in `test_technology_integration.py`

### 90.10 - Research Process âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Status**: âœ… Implemented in `TechnologyManager.research_technology()` with `GameTechnologyManager` integration
- **Note**: To research technology, player gains that technology card from their deck and places it in their play area
- **Tests**: `test_research_technology_updates_game_state()` in `test_technology_integration.py`

### 90.11 - Faction Technology Restriction âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Status**: âœ… Implemented in `TechnologyManager.can_research_faction_technology()`
- **Note**: A player cannot research a faction technology that does not match their faction
- **Tests**: 4 comprehensive tests in `TestRule90FactionTechnologyRestriction` class
- **Implementation**: Complete with confirmed faction technologies (Spec Ops II for Sol, Quantum Datahub Node for Hacan)

### 90.12 - Prerequisite Satisfaction âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Status**: âœ… Implemented in `TechnologyManager.can_research_technology()`
- **Note**: When researching technology, player must satisfy each prerequisite by owning one technology of matching color for each prerequisite symbol
- **Tests**: Comprehensive prerequisite validation tests in `test_rule_90_technology.py`

### 90.13-90.15 - Technology Specialties ðŸ”„ **FRAMEWORK READY**
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ Framework exists but needs planet system integration
- **Note**: Technology specialties on planets can be exhausted to ignore one prerequisite symbol of matching type
- **Implementation**: Requires planet system and exhaustion mechanics

### 90.16-90.22 - Valefar Assimilator ðŸ”„ **FRAMEWORK READY**
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ Framework exists but needs faction-specific implementation
- **Note**: Nekro Virus faction can use Valefar Assimilator tokens to gain faction technologies researched by other players
- **Implementation**: Requires faction-specific mechanics and token system
