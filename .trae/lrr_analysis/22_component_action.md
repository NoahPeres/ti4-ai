## Raw LRR Text

### 22 COMPONENT ACTION
A component action is a type of action that a player can perform during their turn of an action phase.

**22.1** Component actions can be found on various game components, including action cards, technology cards, leaders, exploration cards, relics, promissory notes, and faction sheets. Each component action is indicated by an "Action" header.

**22.2** To perform a component action, a player reads the action's text and follows the instructions as described.

**22.3** A component action cannot be performed if its ability cannot be completely resolved.

**22.4** If a component action is canceled, it does not use that player's action.

**Related Topics**: Abilities, Action Cards, Action Phase, Exploration, Leaders, Promissory Notes, Relics, Technology

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 22.1 - Component Action Sources
**Status**: âœ… SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED - Action Cards Complete
**Implementation**: Action card component actions fully implemented with "Action" header recognition
**Tests**: Comprehensive action card tests in `test_action_cards.py` (39/39 passing)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Notes**: Action cards fully integrated with component action system. Other components (tech, leaders, etc.) still need implementation.

### 22.2 - Action Resolution
**Status**: âœ… SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED - Action Card Resolution Complete
**Implementation**: Action card text parsing and instruction execution fully implemented
**Tests**: Action card resolution tests in `test_action_cards.py`
**Priority**: HIGH
**Notes**: Action card ability text parsing and execution system complete. Other component types need similar implementation.

### 22.3 - Complete Resolution Requirement
**Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED FOR ACTION CARDS
**Implementation**: Action card validation ensures abilities can be completely resolved before execution
**Tests**: Complete resolution validation tests in `test_action_cards.py`
**Priority**: HIGH
**Notes**: Critical rule implemented for action cards - prevents partial ability resolution. Needs extension to other components.

### 22.4 - Action Cancellation
**Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED FOR ACTION CARDS
**Implementation**: Action card cancellation system fully implemented
**Tests**: Action cancellation tests in `test_action_cards.py`
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Notes**: Canceled actions don't consume the player's action for the turn
