# Rule 69: PROMISSORY NOTES

## Category Overview
**Priority**: High  
**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Test Coverage**: âœ… **Comprehensive (11 tests)**  

Each player begins the game with one unique and five generic promissory note cards that can be given to other players. This is a core trading and diplomatic mechanic that enables complex player interactions and strategic agreements.

**Implementation Complete**: All sub-rules implemented with full TDD methodology and comprehensive test coverage.

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 69.1 - Card Resolution
**Raw LRR Text**: "Each promissory note contains timing and ability text; players resolve by following card text"

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Details**: Framework implemented for card resolution. Specific card abilities can be added as needed.

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: High  
**Details**: Implemented `can_player_play_note()` method that prevents players from playing their own promissory notes.

### 69.3 - Card Return Timing
**Raw LRR Text**: "Promissory notes returned after abilities completely resolved"

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: High  
**Details**: Implemented `return_note_after_use()` method that removes notes from player hands after use.

### 69.4 - Reuse After Return
**Raw LRR Text**: "Returned promissory notes can be given to other players again in future transactions"

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: High  
**Details**: Implemented availability tracking system that allows returned notes to be reused in future transactions.

### 69.5 - Transaction Limits

### 69.7 - Elimination Effects
**Raw LRR Text**: "When player eliminated, all matching color/faction promissory notes returned to game box"

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Details**: Implemented `handle_player_elimination()` method that removes all eliminated player's notes from all hands and available pool.
