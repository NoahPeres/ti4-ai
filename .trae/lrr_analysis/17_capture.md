# Rule 17: CAPTURE

## Category Overview
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Complexity**: HIGH  

Rule 17 defines the capture mechanics for units, including placement on faction sheets, return conditions, and blockade interactions. This is a critical combat and strategic mechanic that affects unit availability and player resources.

## Raw LRR Text

### 17 CAPTURE
Some abilities instruct a player to capture a unit, preventing the unit's original owner from using it.

**17.1** If a player captures a non-fighter ship or mech, they place it on their faction sheet. When such a unit is returned, it is placed into the reinforcements of the original owner.

**17.2** A captured non-fighter ship or mech is returned under the following circumstances:
- b. If an ability instructs the capturing player to return the unit as part of an ability's cost.
- c. If the player whose unit was captured blockades a space dock of the player who captured the unit.

**17.3** If a player captures a fighter or infantry, it is placed in its reinforcements instead of on the capturing player's faction sheet; the capturing player places a fighter or infantry token from the supply on their faction sheet instead.

**17.4** Captured fighters and infantry do not belong to any player and are returned only when an ability instructs the capturing player to do so.
- a. Captured fighters and infantry cannot be returned as part of a transaction.
- b. Captured fighters and infantry are not returned as the result of a blockade.
- c. When a captured fighter or infantry is returned, it is placed in the supply.

**17.5** While a unit is captured, it cannot be produced or placed by its original owner until it is returned.

**17.6** If one or more of a player's space docks is being blockaded, that player cannot capture units from the blockading players.
