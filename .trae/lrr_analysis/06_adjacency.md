# Rule 6: ADJACENCY

## Category Overview

Two system tiles are adjacent to each other if any of the tiles' sides are touching each other. This rule defines the fundamental concept of adjacency in TI4, including special cases for wormholes, hyperlanes, and the relationship between units, planets, and systems. Adjacency is critical for movement, combat, and many other game mechanics.

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 6.1 - Wormhole Adjacency

**Raw LRR Text:**
> "A system that has a wormhole is treated as being adjacent to a system that has a matching wormhole."

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Implementation Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Test References:** `test_rule_101_wormholes.py`, wormhole adjacency in `galaxy.py`

**Notes:** Wormhole adjacency fully implemented with matching logic. Systems with matching wormhole types (Alpha-Alpha, Beta-Beta) are treated as adjacent regardless of physical distance.

### 6.2 - Unit/Planet Adjacency to Systems

**Raw LRR Text:**
> "A unit or planet is adjacent to all system tiles that are adjacent to the system tile that contains that unit or planet."
> Sub-rule: "A system is not adjacent to itself."

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Implementation Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Test References:** `test_rule_6_adjacency.py::TestRule6UnitAdjacency`, `galaxy.py::is_unit_adjacent_to_system`

**Notes:** Complete implementation with comprehensive test coverage. Units are adjacent to neighboring systems but not their own system. Includes edge case handling for invalid units/systems.

### 6.3 - Planet Adjacency to Containing System

**Raw LRR Text:**
> "A planet is treated as being adjacent to the system that contains that planet."

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Implementation Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Test References:** `test_rule_6_adjacency.py::TestRule6PlanetAdjacency`, `galaxy.py::is_planet_adjacent_to_system`

**Notes:** Fully implemented with test validation. Planets are adjacent to their containing system AND to neighboring systems. Corrected initial test expectation to match LRR specification.

### 6.4 - Hyperlane Adjacency

**Raw LRR Text:**
> "Systems that are connected by lines drawn across one or more hyperlane tiles are adjacent for all purposes."

**Priority:** LOW
**Implementation Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Test References:** `test_rule_6_adjacency.py::TestRule6HyperlaneAdjacency`, `galaxy.py::add_hyperlane_connection`

**Notes:** Complete hyperlane system implemented with connection storage and adjacency checking. Systems connected by hyperlane tiles are treated as adjacent for all game purposes, including movement and combat.

## Dependencies Summary

**Critical Dependencies:**
- Basic hex coordinate system and distance calculation (âœ… implemented)
