## Raw LRR Text
```
70 PURGE
Purge is a cost that permanently removes a component from the game. If an ability requires that its component is purged, that component can only be used once per game.
70.1 If an ability instructs a player to purge a component, that component is removed from the game and returned to the box.
70.2 Purged components cannot be used or otherwise returned to the game by any means.
70.3 When a player is instructed to purge a component, that component is purged even if its ability was only partially resolved.

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 70.0 Basic Purge Concept
**Rule**: "Purge is a cost that permanently removes a component from the game. If an ability requires that its component is purged, that component can only be used once per game."

**Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No purge system found in codebase
- **Tests**: No purge-related tests found
- **Assessment**: Core purge mechanism not implemented
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Dependencies**: Requires ability system and component tracking
- **Notes**: Foundation for one-time use abilities and permanent removal mechanics

### 70.1 Component Removal Process
**Rule**: "If an ability instructs a player to purge a component, that component is removed from the game and returned to the box."

**Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No component removal system for purging
- **Tests**: No tests for purge removal process
- **Assessment**: Purge removal mechanics not implemented
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Dependencies**: Requires component tracking and game state management
- **Notes**: Need to implement permanent component removal from game state

### 70.2 Permanent Removal Enforcement
**Rule**: "Purged components cannot be used or otherwise returned to the game by any means."

**Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No enforcement of permanent removal
- **Tests**: No tests for purge permanence
- **Assessment**: Permanence enforcement not implemented
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Dependencies**: Requires component state tracking and validation
- **Notes**: Critical for preventing purged components from being reused

### 70.3 Partial Resolution Purging
**Rule**: "When a player is instructed to purge a component, that component is purged even if its ability was only partially resolved."

**Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No partial resolution purge handling
- **Tests**: No tests for partial resolution scenarios
- **Assessment**: Partial resolution purge rules not implemented
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Dependencies**: Requires ability resolution tracking and purge system
- **Notes**: Edge case handling for interrupted abilities
