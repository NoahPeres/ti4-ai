# Rule 78: Space Combat Analysis

## Overview
Space combat is a complex system involving multiple phases and steps. This analysis covers the implementation status of each rule component.

## Rule Breakdown and Test Coverage

### Rule 78.1: Combat Detection
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Description**: Combat occurs when ships of different players occupy the same system during certain game actions.
**Test Cases**:
- `test_combat_detection_with_ships()` - Verifies combat is detected when opposing ships are present
- `test_no_combat_without_ships()` - Verifies no combat when no ships present
- `test_no_combat_same_player()` - Verifies no combat between same player's units

### Rule 78.2: Combat Initiation
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Description**: Combat begins with the first combat round.
**Test Cases**:
- `test_combat_initiation()` - Verifies combat starts properly with correct participants
- `test_combat_round_creation()` - Verifies combat rounds are created with proper structure

### Rule 78.3: Announce Retreats Step
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Description**: At the start of each combat round, the defender may announce retreat.
**Test Cases**:
- `test_announce_retreats_step()` - Verifies defender can announce retreat at round start
- `test_attacker_cannot_announce_retreat()` - Verifies only defender can announce retreat

### Rule 78.4: Roll Dice Step  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Description**: Players roll dice for their participating units.
**Test Cases**:
- `test_roll_dice_step()` - Verifies dice rolling mechanics for combat units
- `test_dice_results_calculation()` - Verifies hit calculation from dice results

### Rule 78.5: Assign Hits Step
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Description**: Players assign hits to their units, potentially destroying them.
**Test Cases**:
- `test_assign_hits_step()` - Verifies hit assignment and unit destruction
- `test_hit_assignment_priority()` - Verifies proper hit assignment rules

### Rule 78.6: Retreat Step
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Description**: If retreat was announced, the retreating player moves their ships.
**Test Cases**:
- `test_retreat_step()` - Verifies retreat execution when announced
- `test_no_retreat_when_not_announced()` - Verifies no retreat when not announced

### Rule 78.7: Retreat Execution
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Description**: When a player announces retreat and has an eligible system, they must move their ships to that system during the retreat step.
**Test Cases**:
- `test_rule_78_7_retreat_execution()` - Verifies that announced retreats are properly executed
  - Tests that defender can announce retreat
  - Tests that retreat execution moves units to retreat system
  - Tests that retreated units are removed from active combat

### Rule 78.8: Combat Continuation After Retreat
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Description**: After retreat execution, if both players still have ships in the system, combat continues with a new round starting at the "Announce Retreats" step.
**Test Cases**:
- `test_rule_78_8_combat_continuation_after_retreat()` - Verifies combat continues after partial retreat
  - Tests that combat continues when both sides have remaining ships
  - Tests that new combat round starts at ANNOUNCE_RETREATS step
  - Tests that retreated units don't participate in continued combat

### Rule 78.9: Combat Ending Conditions
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Description**: Combat ends when one or both players have no ships remaining in the system, or when all eligible players retreat.
**Test Cases**:
- `test_rule_78_9_combat_ends_no_attacker_ships()` - Tests combat ends when attacker has no ships
- `test_rule_78_9_combat_ends_no_defender_ships()` - Tests combat ends when defender has no ships
- `test_rule_78_9_combat_ends_no_ships_either_side()` - Tests combat ends when neither side has ships

### Rule 78.10: Winner and Loser Determination
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Description**: The player with ships remaining in the system after combat is the winner. If no player has ships, the combat is a draw.
**Test Cases**:
- `test_rule_78_10_attacker_wins()` - Tests attacker victory when defender has no ships
  - Verifies winner is set to attacker
  - Verifies loser is set to defender
  - Verifies is_draw is False
- `test_rule_78_10_defender_wins()` - Tests defender victory when attacker has no ships
  - Verifies winner is set to defender  
  - Verifies loser is set to attacker
  - Verifies is_draw is False
- `test_rule_78_10_draw_result()` - Tests draw when neither side has ships
  - Verifies winner is None
  - Verifies loser is None
  - Verifies is_draw is True

## Implementation Notes

### Key Classes
- `SpaceCombat`: Main combat orchestrator
- `CombatRound`: Represents a single round of combat
- `SpaceCombatResult`: Contains final combat outcome
- `CombatDetector`: Determines when combat should occur

### Combat Flow
1. Combat detection triggers `SpaceCombat` creation
2. `start_combat()` creates first `CombatRound`
3. Each round follows the step sequence (announce retreats → roll dice → assign hits → retreat)
4. `should_continue()` checks if combat should continue
5. `end_combat()` determines final result

### Test Coverage Summary
- **Total Test Classes**: 4 (Detection, Basic Mechanics, Resolution, Advanced Mechanics)
- **Total Test Methods**: 20+
- **Rules 78.7-78.10 Coverage**: 7 dedicated test cases
- **Coverage Status**: All core space combat rules implemented and tested

## Recent Updates

- Implemented retreat execution mechanics
- Added proper combat continuation logic after retreats
- Implemented winner/loser/draw determination
- All tests passing as of latest implementation
