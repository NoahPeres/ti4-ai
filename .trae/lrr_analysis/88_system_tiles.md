# Rule 88: SYSTEM TILES

## Category Overview
A system tile represents an area of the galaxy. Players place system tiles during setup to create the game board.

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 88.1 - Color Classification
- **Note**: The back of each system tile is colored green, blue, or red

### 88.2 - Green-Backed Tiles
- **Note**: System tiles with green-colored back are home systems and faction-specific tiles, each unique to one faction

### 88.3 - Blue-Backed Tiles
- **Note**: System tiles with blue-colored back each contain one or more planets

### 88.4 - Red-Backed Tiles
- **Note**: System tiles with red-colored back are anomalies or systems that do not contain planets

### 88.5 - Planet Areas
- **Note**: Planets are located in systems; ground forces and structures are usually placed on planets

### 88.6 - Space Areas
- **Note**: Any area on a system tile that is not a planet is space; ships are usually placed in the space area

### 88.7 - Hyperlane Tiles
- **Note**: Double-sided tiles with lines crossing from edge to edge are hyperlane tiles, which are not systems
