# LRR Rule Analysis: Section 100 - WORMHOLE NEXUS

## Category Overview
The wormhole nexus is a special system tile where multiple wormholes converge, starting inactive with only a gamma wormhole and becoming active with alpha, beta, and gamma wormholes when triggered by player actions.

## Raw LRR Text
```
100 WORMHOLE NEXUS
The wormhole nexus is a system tile where several wormholes converge.
100.1 The wormhole nexus begins the game in play with its inactive side up.
a The inactive side of the wormhole nexus contains a gamma wormhole. The active side of the wormhole nexus contains an alpha, beta, and gamma wormhole.
b  The wormhole nexus is treated as part of the game board.
c	The wormhole nexus is on the edge of the game board.
100.2 After a player moves or places a unit into the wormhole nexus, or gains control of the planet Mallice, that player flips the wormhole nexus to its active side.
a	When a ship moves into the wormhole nexus, the nexus becomes active at the end of the "Movement" step.

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 100.1 Wormhole Nexus Initial State
**Rule**: "The wormhole nexus begins the game in play with its inactive side up."

**Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No wormhole nexus system found
- **Tests**: No wormhole nexus tests
- **Assessment**: Core wormhole nexus mechanics missing entirely
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Dependencies**: Requires wormhole system, dual-sided tile mechanics
- **Notes**: Inactive side has gamma wormhole, active side has alpha, beta, and gamma

### 100.1a Dual Wormhole Configuration
**Rule**: "The inactive side of the wormhole nexus contains a gamma wormhole. The active side of the wormhole nexus contains an alpha, beta, and gamma wormhole."

**Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No wormhole type system
- **Tests**: No wormhole type tests
- **Assessment**: Wormhole type differentiation missing
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Dependencies**: Requires wormhole type system, adjacency calculations
- **Notes**: Critical for adjacency - active nexus connects to all three wormhole types

### 100.1b Game Board Integration
**Rule**: "The wormhole nexus is treated as part of the game board."

**Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No special system tile handling
- **Tests**: No game board integration tests
- **Assessment**: Special tile mechanics missing
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Dependencies**: Requires game board system, special tile handling
- **Notes**: Unlike normal system tiles, nexus is permanent board feature

### 100.1c Edge Placement
**Rule**: "The wormhole nexus is on the edge of the game board."

**Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No edge system mechanics
- **Tests**: No edge placement tests
- **Assessment**: Board edge mechanics missing
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Dependencies**: Requires game board layout system
- **Notes**: Positioning affects movement and adjacency calculations

### 100.2 Activation Trigger
**Rule**: "After a player moves or places a unit into the wormhole nexus, or gains control of the planet Mallice, that player flips the wormhole nexus to its active side."

**Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No activation trigger system
- **Tests**: No activation tests
- **Assessment**: State change mechanics missing entirely
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Dependencies**: Requires movement system, planet control, state management
- **Notes**: Multiple trigger conditions - unit movement/placement or Mallice control

### 100.2a Movement Timing
**Rule**: "When a ship moves into the wormhole nexus, the nexus becomes active at the end of the 'Movement' step."

**Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No movement step integration
- **Tests**: No movement timing tests
- **Assessment**: Movement step timing missing
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Dependencies**: Requires tactical action system, movement steps
- **Notes**: Timing is critical - activation happens after movement resolves

## Test References

### Current Coverage
- **test_enhanced_exceptions.py**: References "mecatol_rex" system ID
- **test_game_logger.py**: References "mecatol_rex" in logging context
- **test_scenario_library.py**: References mecatol_rex system access
- **No wormhole nexus-specific tests found**

### Missing Test Scenarios
- Wormhole nexus initial inactive state
- Activation triggers (unit movement, Mallice control)
- Dual wormhole configuration (inactive vs active)
- Adjacency changes when nexus activates
- Movement timing and activation sequence
- Edge placement and board integration

## Implementation Files

### Core Files
- **Missing**: Wormhole nexus system implementation
- **Missing**: Wormhole type differentiation system
- **Missing**: Dual-sided tile mechanics

### Supporting Files
- **src/ti4/core/system.py**: Basic system structure exists
- **Missing**: Wormhole adjacency calculations
- **Missing**: State change trigger system
- **Missing**: Movement step integration

## Notable Details

### Strengths
- Basic system structure exists in codebase
- Mecatol Rex system referenced in tests (similar special system)
- Game state management framework present

### Areas Needing Attention
- **No wormhole implementation**: Complete absence of wormhole mechanics
- **Missing dual-sided tiles**: No support for tiles with multiple states
- **No activation triggers**: No system for state changes based on player actions
- **Missing wormhole types**: No differentiation between alpha, beta, gamma wormholes
- **No adjacency integration**: Wormhole adjacency rules not implemented

## Action Items

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement basic wormhole system with type differentiation (alpha, beta, gamma)
- [ ] Create wormhole nexus dual-sided tile mechanics
- [ ] Add activation trigger system for unit movement and planet control

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement wormhole adjacency calculations
- [ ] Add movement step timing integration
- [ ] Create comprehensive wormhole nexus tests
- [ ] Integrate with existing system tile framework

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add game board edge placement mechanics
- [ ] Create wormhole nexus visual representation
- [ ] Add advanced wormhole interaction scenarios

## Priority Assessment
**Overall Priority**: MEDIUM
**Implementation Status**: 5% (only basic system framework)
**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Dependencies**: Wormhole system, movement mechanics, state management

The wormhole nexus is a specialized game feature that significantly impacts late-game strategy through enhanced connectivity. While not essential for basic gameplay, it's important for complete rule implementation and strategic depth.
