# Rule 82: STRATEGIC ACTION

## Category Overview
**Priority**: High
**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Test Coverage**: âœ… **Comprehensive (8 tests)**

During the action phase, the active player may perform a strategic action to resolve the primary ability on their strategy card. This is a core game mechanic that drives the strategic flow and player interaction in TI4.

**Implementation Complete**: All sub-rules implemented with full TDD methodology and comprehensive test coverage.

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 82.1 - Secondary Ability Resolution
**Raw LRR Text**: "After the active player resolves the primary ability, each other player may resolve that strategy card's secondary ability in clockwise order"

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: High
**Details**: Implemented in `StrategicActionManager.execute_secondary_abilities()` with proper clockwise player order and optional participation.

### 82.2 - Strategy Card Exhaustion
**Raw LRR Text**: "After all players have had opportunity to resolve secondary ability, active player exhausts their strategy card facedown"

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: High
**Details**: Implemented automatic strategy card exhaustion after all secondary abilities are resolved in `StrategicActionManager.execute_strategic_action()`.

### 82.3 - Ability Resolution Order
**Raw LRR Text**: "When resolving primary or secondary abilities from a strategy card, player resolves each effect from top to bottom"

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: Medium
**Details**: Implemented sequential ability resolution with proper ordering in strategy card execution methods.
