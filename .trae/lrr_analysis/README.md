# LRR Rule Analysis Workflow

## Purpose
This directory contains a comprehensive manual analysis of the Living Rules Reference (LRR) for Twilight Imperium 4th Edition. Each rule is carefully analyzed and mapped to corresponding test cases in the codebase.

## Methodology
1. Each rule category has its own file in the format `rule_XX_category_name.md`
2. Rules are analyzed in sequential order, with no shortcuts or automation
3. Each rule is manually assessed for implementation status and test coverage
4. Test references are provided for implemented rules
5. Action items are identified for unimplemented or partially implemented rules

## Structure
- `template.md` - Template for rule analysis
- `rule_XX_category_name.md` - Individual rule category analysis files
- `implementation_status.md` - Overall status summary and statistics

## Workflow for Rule Analysis
1. Read the rule carefully and understand its implications
2. Search the codebase for relevant test cases
3. Assess implementation status (Unstarted, In Progress, Completed)
4. Document test coverage with specific file and function references
5. Add detailed implementation notes and action items
6. Update the implementation status summary

## No Shortcuts Policy
As directed, this analysis is performed manually with careful consideration of each rule. No automation or shortcuts are used in the analysis process. This ensures deep understanding of each rule and accurate assessment of implementation status.

## Usage
This documentation serves as the definitive reference for rule implementation status and will be updated as implementation progresses. When making changes to core game logic, this documentation must be updated to reflect the current status.
