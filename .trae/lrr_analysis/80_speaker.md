# Rule 80: SPEAKER

## Category Overview
The speaker is the player who has the speaker token.

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 80.1 - Initiative Order ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **LRR**: During the strategy phase, the speaker is the first player to choose a strategy card
- **Implementation**: `get_initiative_order()` method returns speaker first in player order
- **Tests**: Verified speaker appears first in initiative order

### 80.2 - Breaking Ties ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **LRR**: During the agenda phase, the speaker reveals the top agenda card from the agenda deck before each vote. The speaker is always the last player to vote and decides which outcome to resolve if the outcomes are tied
- **Implementation**: `break_tie()` method gives speaker priority in tie resolution
- **Tests**: Verified speaker wins ties when involved, uses initiative order otherwise

### 80.3 - Token Passing ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **LRR**: During setup, the speaker prepares the objectives
- **Implementation**: `pass_speaker_token()` method for agenda phase token passing
- **Tests**: Verified token can be passed to chosen player with validation

### 80.4 - Politics Strategy Card ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **LRR**: During the action phase, if a player resolves the primary ability on the "Politics" strategy card, that player chooses any player other than the current speaker to gain the speaker token
- **Implementation**: `politics_card_choose_speaker()` method prevents choosing current speaker
- **Tests**: Verified current speaker cannot be chosen, other players can be chosen

### 80.5 - Random Assignment ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL
- **LRR**: A random player gains the speaker token during setup before the game begins
- **Implementation**: Basic assignment exists but no random selection method
- **Status**: Needs random speaker assignment for game setup

### 80.6 - Politics Integration ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **LRR**: Same as 80.4 - covered above
- **Implementation**: Complete with validation
- **Tests**: Comprehensive coverage

### 80.7 - Elimination Handling ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **LRR**: If the speaker is eliminated from the game, the speaker token is passed to the player to the speaker's left
- **Implementation**: `handle_speaker_elimination()` method passes token clockwise
- **Tests**: Verified elimination passes token to next player, handles wraparound

## Implementation Status: 85% Complete
