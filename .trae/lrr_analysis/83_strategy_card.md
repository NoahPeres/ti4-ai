# Rule 83: STRATEGY CARD - Analysis

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Complete implementation with comprehensive test coverage

**AUDIT FINDING**: Rule 83 is fully implemented with all sub-rules complete, comprehensive test coverage, and full integration with game systems. No further implementation work required.

**LRR Reference**: Rule 83 - STRATEGY CARD

## Raw LRR Text

83 STRATEGY CARD
Each strategy card has a readied side and an exhausted side. The readied side contains the strategy card's name, initiative number, and abilities. The exhausted side contains the strategy card's name and initiative number.

83.1 Each strategy card has a primary ability and a secondary ability.

83.2 During the strategy phase, each player chooses a strategy card from those that are available.

83.3 A player can resolve a strategy card's primary ability during their turn of the action phase.

83.4 After a player resolves a strategy card's primary ability, each other player may resolve that strategy card's secondary ability.

83.5 After resolving a strategy card's primary or secondary ability, that card becomes exhausted.

83.6 Strategy cards are readied during the status phase.

## Implementation Details

### Strategy Card Selection (Rule 83.2)
- Players select cards in speaker order during strategy phase
- Validation ensures each player gets exactly one card
- Support for variable player counts (3-8 players)
- Strategy phase completion tracking

### Primary/Secondary Abilities (Rule 83.1, 83.3, 83.4)
- Primary abilities can only be used by card owner
- Secondary abilities available to all other players
