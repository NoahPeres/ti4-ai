# LRR Rule Analysis: Section 99 - WARFARE (STRATEGY CARD)

## Category Overview
The Warfare strategy card (initiative 6) allows players to remove command tokens from the board and redistribute their command tokens between pools, providing tactical flexibility and command token management.

## Raw LRR Text
```
99 WARFARE (STRATEGY CARD)
The "Warfare" strategy card allows a player to remove a command token from the board and redistribute their command tokens between their tactic, fleet, and strategy pools. This card's initiative value is "6." During the action phase, if the active player has the "Warfare" strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card's primary ability.
To resolve the primary ability on the "Warfare" strategy card, the active player performs the following steps:
99.1 STEP 1-The active player removes any one of their command tokens from the game board. Then, that player gains that command token by placing it in a pool of their choice on their command sheet.
99.2 STEP 2-The active player can redistribute their command tokens.
```

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 99.1 Command Token Removal (Step 1)
**Rule**: "The active player removes any one of their command tokens from the game board. Then, that player gains that command token by placing it in a pool of their choice on their command sheet."

**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: `WarfareStrategyCard.execute_step_1()` method implemented
- **Tests**: `test_can_remove_command_token_from_board()`, `test_removed_token_placed_in_chosen_pool()`
- **Assessment**: Core mechanic implemented with minimal board token simulation
- **Priority**: COMPLETED
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Command token pool management (Rule 20)
- **Notes**: Provides tactical flexibility and command token economy management

### 99.2 Command Token Redistribution (Step 2)
**Rule**: "The active player can redistribute their command tokens."

**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
- **Code**: `WarfareStrategyCard.redistribute_tokens()` and `CommandSheet.redistribute_tokens()` methods
- **Tests**: `test_can_redistribute_command_tokens_between_pools()`, `test_redistribution_preserves_total_token_count()`
- **Assessment**: Full redistribution mechanics with token count preservation
- **Priority**: COMPLETED
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Command pool system (Rule 20)
- **Notes**: Enables strategic command token allocation between pools

### 99.3 Secondary Ability
**Rule**: "After the active player resolves the primary ability of the 'Warfare' strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool to resolve the 'Production' ability of one space dock in their home system."

**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: `WarfareStrategyCard.execute_secondary_ability()` method
- **Tests**: `test_other_players_can_spend_strategy_token_for_production()`, `test_secondary_ability_does_not_place_command_token_in_home_system()`
- **Assessment**: Secondary ability mechanics with proper token spending and Rule 99.3a compliance
- **Priority**: COMPLETED
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Strategy token spending (Rule 20)
- **Notes**: Follows standard strategy card secondary ability pattern

### 99.4 Initiative Value
**Rule**: "This card's initiative value is '6.'"

**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: Strategy card system includes initiative values
- **Tests**: Initiative ordering tests exist in test_game_controller.py
- **Assessment**: Basic strategy card framework exists
- **Priority**: LOW

### 99.5 Strategic Action Requirement
**Rule**: "During the action phase, if the active player has the 'Warfare' strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card's primary ability."

**Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Code**: No warfare-specific strategic action
- **Tests**: No warfare strategic action tests
- **Assessment**: Strategy card activation missing
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Dependencies**: Requires strategic action system, warfare card logic
- **Notes**: Part of core strategy card mechanics
