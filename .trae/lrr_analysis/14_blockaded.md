# Rule 14: BLOCKADED

## Category Overview
**Priority**: High
**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Test Coverage**: âœ… **Comprehensive (16 tests)**

Rule 14 defines the blockade mechanic, which restricts production capabilities of units when enemy ships are present in the same system without friendly ships. This is a critical strategic mechanic that affects production, unit capture, and territorial control.

**Implementation Complete**: All sub-rules implemented with full TDD methodology and comprehensive test coverage.

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 14.0 - Core Definition
**Raw LRR Text**: "A player's unit with 'Production' is blockaded if it is in a system that does not contain any of their ships and contains other players' ships."

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: High
**Details**: Implemented in `BlockadeManager.is_unit_blockaded()` with full system-level ship presence validation and production unit detection.

### 14.1 - Production Restrictions
**Raw LRR Text**: "A player cannot use a blockaded unit to produce ships; that player can still use a blockaded unit to produce ground forces."

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: High
**Details**: Implemented `can_produce_ships()` (returns False when blockaded) and `can_produce_ground_forces()` (always returns True) methods.

### 14.2 - Unit Return Mechanism
**Raw LRR Text**: "When a player blockades another player's space dock, if the blockaded player has captured any of the blockading player's units, those units are returned to the blockading player's reinforcements."

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: Medium
**Details**: Implemented `apply_blockade_effects()` with full capture system integration. Automatically returns captured units from blockading players.

### 14.2a - Capture Prevention
**Raw LRR Text**: "While a player is blockading another player, the blockaded player cannot capture any of the blockading player's units."

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: Medium
**Details**: Implemented `can_capture_unit()` method that prevents blockaded players from capturing blockading player's units while allowing captures from other players.
