# Rule 16: CAPACITY (ATTRIBUTE)

## Category Overview
**Priority**: HIGH - Core game mechanic affecting unit transport, fleet composition, and space area management
**Complexity**: MEDIUM - Involves multiple validation layers and transport mechanics
**Dependencies**: Movement, Transport, Fleet Management, Combat System

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 16.0 - Core Definition
**Raw LRR Text**: "Capacity is an attribute of some units that is presented on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards."
**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: Unit capacity attribute is implemented in UnitStats class and accessible via Unit.get_capacity()
**Test Coverage**: ✅ Comprehensive tests in test_unit.py

### 16.1 - Transport Limits
**Raw LRR Text**: "A unit's capacity value indicates the maximum combined number of fighters and ground forces that it can transport."
**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: Transport validation implemented in TransportValidator class with capacity checking
**Test Coverage**: ✅ Tests in test_movement.py and test_tactical_action.py

### 16.2 - System Space Area Capacity
**Raw LRR Text**: "The combined capacity values of a player's ships in a system determine the number of fighters and ground forces that player can have in that system's space area."
**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: Fleet capacity calculation implemented in Fleet.get_total_capacity() and validated by FleetCapacityValidator
**Test Coverage**: ✅ Comprehensive tests in test_fleet_management.py

### 16.3 - Excess Unit Removal
**Raw LRR Text**: "If a player has more fighters and ground forces in the space area of a system than the total capacity of that player's ships in that system, that player must remove the excess units."
**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: Fleet capacity validation prevents invalid fleet compositions
**Test Coverage**: ✅ Tests for capacity validation and excess unit detection

### 16.3a - Player Choice in Removal
**Raw LRR Text**: "A player can choose which of their excess units to remove."
**Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: No mechanism for player to choose which excess units to remove
**Test Coverage**: ❌ No tests for excess unit removal choice

### 16.3b - Planetary Units Exception
**Raw LRR Text**: "Ground forces on planets do not count against capacity."
**Implementation Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: Fleet capacity validation only considers space area units
**Test Coverage**: ✅ Implicit in existing tests

### 16.3c - Combat Exception
**Raw LRR Text**: "A player's fighters and ground forces do not count against capacity during combat. At the end of combat, any excess units are removed and returned to that player's reinforcements."
**Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: No special capacity handling during combat phases
**Test Coverage**: ❌ No tests for combat capacity exceptions

### 16.4 - Unit Assignment
**Raw LRR Text**: "Fighters and ground forces are not assigned to specific ships, except while they are being transported."
**Implementation Status**: ✅ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: Transport operations assign units to specific ships temporarily, but general fleet management doesn't require specific assignments
**Test Coverage**: ✅ Transport assignment tests exist
