**Raw LRR Text**: "A unit's capacity value indicates the maximum combined number of fighters and ground forces that it can transport."
**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: Transport validation implemented in TransportValidator class with capacity checking
**Test Coverage**: ‚úÖ Tests in test_movement.py and test_tactical_action.py

### 16.2 - System Space Area Capacity
**Raw LRR Text**: "The combined capacity values of a player's ships in a system determine the number of fighters and ground forces that player can have in that system's space area."
**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: Fleet capacity calculation implemented in Fleet.get_total_capacity() and validated by FleetCapacityValidator
**Test Coverage**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive tests in test_fleet_management.py

### 16.3 - Excess Unit Removal
**Raw LRR Text**: "If a player has more fighters and ground forces in the space area of a system than the total capacity of that player's ships in that system, that player must remove the excess units."
**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: Fleet capacity validation prevents invalid fleet compositions
**Test Coverage**: ‚úÖ Tests for capacity validation and excess unit detection

## Implementation Status Summary
**Overall Rule Status**: üü° PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (6/7 sub-rules complete)
**Completion Percentage**: 86%

### Completed Sub-Rules:
- ‚úÖ 16.0 - Core Definition
- ‚úÖ 16.1 - Transport Limits
- ‚úÖ 16.2 - System Space Area Capacity
- ‚úÖ 16.3 - Excess Unit Removal (validation)
- ‚úÖ 16.3a - Player Choice in Removal
- ‚úÖ 16.3b - Planetary Units Exception

### Remaining Sub-Rules:
- ‚ùå 16.3c - Combat Exception (capacity doesn't apply during combat)

### 16.3a - Player Choice in Removal
**Raw LRR Text**: "A player can choose which of their excess units to remove."
**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: FleetCapacityEnforcer.remove_excess_units_with_choice() allows player to specify which units to remove
**Test Coverage**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive tests in test_capacity_excess_removal.py
**Test Cases Demonstrating Implementation**:
- `test_player_choice_remove_excess_fighters`: Player chooses which fighters to remove when capacity exceeded
- `test_player_choice_remove_mixed_excess_units`: Player chooses mix of fighters and ground forces to remove
- `test_invalid_choice_insufficient_units`: Error handling when player doesn't choose enough units
- `test_invalid_choice_non_capacity_units`: Error handling when player tries to remove units that don't count against capacity
- `test_no_removal_when_within_capacity`: No removal occurs when fleet is within capacity limits

### 16.3b - Planetary Units Exception
**Raw LRR Text**: "Ground forces on planets do not count against capacity."
**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: Fleet capacity validation only considers space area units
**Test Coverage**: ‚úÖ Implicit in existing tests

### 16.3c - Combat Exception
**Raw LRR Text**: "A player's fighters and ground forces do not count against capacity during combat. At the end of combat, any excess units are removed and returned to that player's reinforcements."
**Implementation Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: No special capacity handling during combat phases
**Test Coverage**: ‚ùå No tests for combat capacity exceptions

### 16.4 - Unit Assignment
**Raw LRR Text**: "Fighters and ground forces are not assigned to specific ships, except while they are being transported."
**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Details**: Transport operations assign units to specific ships temporarily, but general fleet management doesn't require specific assignments
**Test Coverage**: ‚úÖ Transport assignment tests exist
