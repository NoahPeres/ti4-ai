38 GAME ROUND
A game round consists of the following four phases, resolved in order:

38.1 Strategy Phase: Each player chooses a strategy card.
38.2 Action Phase: Players take turns performing actions.
38.3 Status Phase: Players resolve abilities and refresh components.
38.4 Agenda Phase: Players resolve political cards and elect new speaker.

After the agenda phase, a new game round begins with the strategy phase.

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 38.1 Strategy Phase
- **Status:** WELL IMPLEMENTED
- **Description:** Each player chooses a strategy card during this phase
- **Implementation:** Complete strategy phase system with card selection and turn order

### 38.2 Action Phase
- **Status:** WELL IMPLEMENTED
- **Description:** Players take turns performing actions in initiative order
- **Implementation:** Full action phase with turn management, passing, and completion detection

### 38.3 Status Phase
- **Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Description:** Players resolve abilities and refresh components
- **Gap:** Status phase mechanics exist but not fully integrated with round progression

### 38.4 Agenda Phase
- **Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Description:** Players resolve political cards and elect new speaker
- **Gap:** Agenda phase structure exists but political mechanics not fully implemented

## Implementation Files

### Core Implementation
- Game state machine for phase transitions
- Game phase enumeration system
- Game controller for phase management
- Comprehensive test coverage for phases

### Missing Implementation
- Round counter management
- Status phase mechanics integration
- Agenda phase mechanics integration
- Round completion detection
- Cross-round state persistence

## Notable Implementation Details

### Well Implemented
- Comprehensive phase transition system
- Complete phase enumeration
- Phase advancement with events
- Strategy phase card selection and turn order
- Action phase turn management and passing
- Phase transition validation and error handling
- Comprehensive test coverage for core mechanics

### Gaps and Issues
- No round counter tracking or increment system
- Status phase mechanics not integrated with round flow
- Agenda phase mechanics not integrated with round flow
- No automatic round progression after agenda phase
- Missing round completion detection
- No cross-round state persistence validation
- Victory condition checking not tied to round progression

## Action Items

1. **Implement round counter system** - Track current round number and increment after each agenda phase
2. **Integrate status phase mechanics** - Connect status phase resolution with round progression
3. **Integrate agenda phase mechanics** - Connect agenda phase resolution with round progression
4. **Add automatic round progression** - Automatically start new round after agenda phase completion
5. **Implement round completion detection** - Detect when all four phases of a round are complete
6. **Add cross-round state persistence** - Ensure game state persists correctly across rounds
7. **Integrate victory condition checking** - Check victory conditions at appropriate round points
8. **Create round progression tests** - Test complete round cycles and progression
9. **Add round-based game events** - Emit events for round start/end and phase transitions
10. **Implement round history tracking** - Track round history for game analysis and replay

## Priority Assessment
**HIGH** - Core game structure that's well implemented for individual phases but needs better round-level integration. The phase transition system is excellent, but round progression and cross-phase integration need enhancement. Critical for proper game flow and long-term game state management.
