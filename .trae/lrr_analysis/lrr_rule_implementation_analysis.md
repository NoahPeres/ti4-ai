# LRR Rule Implementation Analysis

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive, manual analysis of each rule in the Living Rules Reference (LRR) for Twilight Imperium 4th Edition. Each rule is analyzed individually to determine:

1. Current implementation status
2. Corresponding test cases (if any)
3. Implementation quality assessment
4. Priority for implementation/improvement
5. Action items for unimplemented or partially implemented rules

This analysis is performed manually, with careful consideration of each rule and its implications for the game framework.

## Continuing Analysis

This document will be expanded to cover all 101 rule categories in the LRR, with each rule receiving the same level of detailed analysis. The analysis will proceed sequentially through the LRR, with no shortcuts or automation.

Each rule will be carefully examined to determine its implementation status, test coverage, and any action items needed for complete implementation. This thorough, manual analysis will serve as the foundation for ongoing development and improvement of the game framework.
