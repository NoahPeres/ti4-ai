# Rule 91: TECHNOLOGY (STRATEGY CARD)

## Category Overview
The "Technology" strategy card allows players to research new technology. This card's initiative value is "7."

## Sub-Rules Analysis

### 91.1 - Strategic Action
- **Note**: During the action phase, if the active player has the "Technology" strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card's primary ability

### 91.2 - Primary Ability
- **Note**: To resolve the primary ability, the active player can research one technology of their choice, then may research one additional technology by spending six resources

### 91.3 - Secondary Ability
- **Note**: After the active player resolves the primary ability, each other player may research one technology by spending one command token from their strategy pool and four resources
